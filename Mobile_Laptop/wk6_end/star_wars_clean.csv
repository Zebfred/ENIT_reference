4989,skims across a rooftop as obiwan is forced to lift his
4990,legs tenaciously hanging onto the droid the droid heads
4991,for a dirty beatup speeder hidden in an alcove of a
4992,building about twenty stories up when the pilot of the
4993,speeder the scruffy bounty hunter zam wesell sees the
4994,droid approach with obiwan hanging on she pulls a long
4995,rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the jedi
4996,explosions burst all around obiwan zam runs to her
4997,speeder jumps in and takes off
4998,
4999,obiwan i have a bad feeling about this
5000,
5001,finally the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up obi
5002,wan falls fifty stories until a speeder drops down next to
5003,him and he manages to grab onto the back end of the
5004,speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit the jedi
5005,struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open
5006,speeder and sit down next to the driver anakin
5007,
5008,anakin that was wacky i almost lost you in the traffic
5009,

5015,really gonzo color
5016,
5017,they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam as she fires out the
5018,open window at them with her laser pistol
5019,
5020,obiwan if youd spend as much time working on your saber
5021,skills as you do on your wit young padawan you would

5026,obiwan only in your mind my very young apprentice
5027,careful hey easy

5029,as this conversation is going on anakin deftly moves in
5030,and out of the oncoming traffic across lanes between
5031,buildings and miraculously through a construction site

5033,
5034,anakin sorry i forgot you dont like flying master

5064,zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic deliberately trying
5065,to throw the jedi off oncoming speeders swerve trying to
5066,avoid zam and the jedi zam does a quick tight loopover
5067,and ends up behind the jedi she is now in a much better
5068,position to fire at them with her laser pistol to avoid
5069,being hit by the laser bolts anakin slams on the brakes
5070,and moves alongside zam she now fires pointblank at obi
5071,wan

5079,hunter skims over the rooftops causing anakin to drop
5080,behind anakin goes through his gears zooming around
5081,traffic they race at high speed across a wide flat
5082,surface of the city planet a large spacecraft almost
5083,collides with them as it attempts to land 
5084,
5085,obiwan watch out for those banners
5086,
5087,they round a corner and clip a flag which gets caught on
5088,one of the front air scoops
5089,
5090,obiwan that was too close
5091,
5092,anakin clear that
5093,

5098,
5099,obiwan leans out of the speeder then crawls out onto the
5100,front engine and pulls the flag free of the scoop the
5101,speeder lurches forward with a surge of power
5102,
5103,obiwan whooooaaa dont do that i dont  like it when

5105,
5106,anakin so sorry master
5107,

5109,shoots a power coupler causing voltage like lightning to
5110,jump across a gap from one coupler to another anakin stays
5111,on course piloting the speeder directly through the arc
5112,anakin and obiwans bodies ripple with blue power
5113,
5114,obiwan anakin how many times have i told you to stay
5115,away from the power couplings slow down dont go through
5116,there
5117,

5127,anakin that was crazy
5128,
5129,zam slides around a corner sideways blocking an alley
5130,firing pointblank as anakin approaches
5131,
5132,anakin ahh damn
5133,
5134,obiwan stop
5135,
5136,anakin no we can make it
5137,
5138,anakin barely misses the bounty hunters speeder as he
5139,dives under it and through a small gap in the building
5140,hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control
5141,anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder narrowly
5142,missing a crane barely clipping a pair of giant struts a
5143,giant gas ball shoots up causing anakin to spin and bump a
5144,building stalling the speeder
5145,
5146,obiwan im crazy im crazy im crazy
5147,
5148,anakin i got us through that one all right

5161,obiwan furious but you didnt and now weve lost him
5162,for good
5163,
5164,suddenly there is an ambush laser bolts are everywhere

5166,take off
5167,
5168,anakin no we didnt
5169,
5170,out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear
5171,after zam they are smoking obiwan slaps out the small
5172,fire on the dashboard zam goes up and down through cross
5173,traffic there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits
5174,them zam turns down and left between two buildings anakin
5175,pulls up and to the right
5176,
5177,obiwan where are you going he went down there the
5178,other way

5183,this is a shortcut i think
5184,
5185,obiwan sarcastic what do you mean you think
5186,
5187,anakin turns up a side street zooming up several small
5188,passageways then stops hovering about fifty stories up
5189,
5190,obiwan well you lost him
5191,
5192,anakin im deeply sorry master
5193,
5194,anakin looks around front and back he spots something he
5195,seems to  start counting to himself as he watches something
5196,below approach
5197,
5198,obiwan well this is some kind of shortcut he went
5199,completely the other way once again anakin
5200,
5201,anakin excuse me for a moment
5202,
5203,anakin jumps out of the speeder obiwan looks down and
5204,sees zams speeder about five stories below them cruising
5205,past 
5206,
5207,obiwan i hate it when he does that
5208,
5209,anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunters
5210,speeder the speeder wobbles under the impact zam looks up
5211,and realizes what has happened
5212,
5213,zam takes off and anakin slides to the back strut and
5214,almost slips off but manages to hang on anakin works his
5215,way back to zam who caught off guard briefly changes
5216,into her clawdite form zam stops suddenly and anakin
5217,flies forward to the left front fork zam shoots at him
5218,with a laser pistol there is a blast near anakins hand
5219,which breaks off a piece of the speeder anakin slides to
5220,the right fork of the speeder where zam cant reach him
5221,he scrambles to the top holding onto an air scoop
5222,
5223,
5224,obiwan has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder
5225,and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder the two
5226,speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through
5227,cross traffic finally anakin is able to get hold of his
5228,lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of
5229,the speeder zam takes out her laser pistol and starts
5230,firing at the helpless jedi knocking the sword out of his
5231,hand obiwan races under the speeder and catches the jedi
5232,weapon in the passengers seat
5233,
5234,anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and using the
5235,force pulls the gun out of zams hand she grabs the
5236,jedis hand and they struggle for the weapon it goes off
5237,blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder the speeder
5238,careens wildly out of control zam struggles to pull the
5239,speeder out of its nosedive obiwan gets slowed down by
5240,traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunters speeder
5241,
5242,just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground
5243,zam pulls it out and it slides hard on the pavement in a
5244,shower of sparks anakin goes flying into the street
5245,
5246,exterior entertainment street  night
5247,
5248,zam exits the crashed speeder and runs anakin picks
5249,himself up off the pavement and runs after her down the

5252,its the seedy underbelly of the city broken sidewalks
5253,garish lights reflected in filthy puddles its pretty
5254,crowded with various alien lowlifes panhandling droids

5258,fleeing zam he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd then
5259,sees her again the young jedi is having a very difficult
5260,time getting through the crowd ahead zam turns in through
5261,a door and disappears a nightclub sign is flashing over

5265,and runs through the crowd toward anakin anakin is just

5922,about it his leaving was a great loss to the order
5923,
5924,obiwan what happened
5925,
5926,jocasta nu well count dooku was always a bit out of step
5927,with the decisions of the council much like your old
5928,master quigon jinn
5929,
5930,obiwan surprised really
5931,
5932,jocasta nu oh yes they were alike in many ways very
5933,individual thinkers idealists
5934,
5935,jocasta nu gazes at the bust
5936,
5937,jocasta nu he was always striving to become a more
5938,powerful jedi he wanted to be the best with a lightsaber
5939,in the old style of fencing he had no match his knowledge
5940,of the force was unique in the end i think he left
5941,because he lost faith in the republic he believed that
5942,politics were corrupt and he felt the jedi betrayed
5943,themselves by serving the politicians he always had very
5944,high expectations of government he disappeared for nine or
5945,ten years then just showed up recently as the head of the
5946,separatist movement
5947,
5948,obiwan its very interesting im not sure i completely
5949,understand
5950,
5951,jocasta nu well im sure you didnt call me over here for
5952,a history lesson are you having a problem master kenobi
5953,
5954,obiwan yes im trying to find a planet system called
5955,kamino it doesnt seem to show up on any of the archive
5956,charts
5957,
5958,jocasta nu kamino its not a system im familiar with
5959,let me see
5960,
5961,jocasta nu leans over obiwans shoulder looking at the
5962,screen
5963,
5964,jocasta nu are you sure you have the right coordinates
5965,
5966,obiwan nodding according to my information it should
5967,be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the rishi
5968,maze
5969,
5970,jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns
5971,
5972,jocasta nu no coordinates it sounds like the sort of
5973,directions youd get from a street tout some old miner
5974,or furbog trader
5975,
5976,obiwan all three actually
5977,
5978,jocasta nu are you sure it exists
5979,
5980,obiwan absolutely
5981,
5982,jocasta nu let me do a gravitational scan
5983,
5984,obiwan and jocasta nu study the star map hologram
5985,
5986,jocasta nu there are some inconsistencies here maybe the
5987,planet youre seeking was destroyed
5988,
5989,obiwan wouldnt that be on record
5990,
5991,jocasta nu it ought to be unless it was very recent
5992,shakes her head i hate to say it but it looks like the
5993,system youre searching for doesnt exist
5994,
5995,obiwan thats impossible perhaps the archives are
5996,incomplete
5997,
5998,jocasta nu the archives are comprehensive and totally
5999,secure my young jedi one thing you may be absolutely sure
6000,of  if an item does not appear in our records it does not
6001,exist
6002,
6003,obiwan stares at her then looks back to the map jocasta
6004,nu notices a young boy approach she turns from obiwan and
6005,leaves with the youngster
6006,
6007,exterior space starship freighter
6008,
6009,the massive slowmoving freighter moves through space
6010,
6011,interior starfreighter steerage hold  day
6012,
6013,the great gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their
6014,belongings to one side artoo is coming to the head of a
6015,food line holding two bowls with one of his little claw
6016,arms he grabs a chunk of something that looks like bread
6017,
6018,artoo slips a tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large
6019,quantity a server sees him
6020,
6021,server hey no droids
6022,
6023,artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food
6024,line the server shouts after him angrily the little droid
6025,moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes
6026,to anakin and padmés table where anakin is sound asleep
6027,the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare he is very
6028,restless
6029,
6030,anakin no no mom no
6031,
6032,he is sweating padmé leans over resting her hand on his
6033,arm he wakes up with a start then realizes where he is
6034,padmé simply looks at him he stares back somewhat
6035,confused
6036,
6037,anakin what
6038,
6039,padmé you seemed to be having a nightmare
6040,
6041,anakin looks at padmé a little more closely trying to see
6042,if he has revealed any of his secrets she hands him a bowl
6043,of mush and bread
6044,
6045,padmé are you hungry
6046,
6047,anakin yeah
6048,
6049,padmé takes the food from artoo and sets it on a makeshift
6050,table anakin rises and takes a seat as she places a bowl
6051,in front of him
6052,
6053,anakin thanks
6054,
6055,padmé we went to lightspeed a while ago
6056,
6057,anakin looks into padmés eyes
6058,
6059,anakin i look forward to seeing naboo again ive thought
6060,about it every day since i left its by far the most
6061,beautiful place ive ever seen
6062,
6063,padmé is a little unnerved by his intense stare 
6064,
6065,padmé it may not be as you remember it time changes
6066,perception
6067,
6068,anakin sometimes it does sometimes for the better
6069,
6070,padmé it must be difficult having sworn your life to the
6071,jedi not being able to visit the places you like or
6072,do the things you like
6073,
6074,anakin or be with the people i love
6075,
6076,padmé are you allowed to love i thought it was forbidden
6077,for a jedi
6078,
6079,anakin attachment is forbidden possession is forbidden
6080,compassion which i would define as unconditional love is
6081,central to a jedis life so you might say were encouraged
6082,to love
6083,
6084,padmé you have changed so much
6085,
6086,anakin you havent changed a bit youre exactly the way i
6087,remember you in my dreams i doubt if naboo has changed
6088,much either
6089,
6090,padmé it hasnt
6091,
6092,there is an awkward moment
6093,
6094,padmé continuing changing the subject you were dreaming
6095,about your mother earlier werent you
6096,
6097,anakin yes i left tatooine so long ago my memory of
6098,her is fading i dont want to lose it recently ive been
6099,seeing her in my dreams vivid dreams scary dreams i
6100,worry about her

6111,obiwan comes out onto the veranda and stops watching
6112,twenty or so fouryearolds doing training exercises
6113,supervised by yoda they wear helmets over their eyes and
6114,try to strike little training droids with their miniature
6115,lightsabers the droids dance in front of them
6116,
6117,yoda dont think feel be as one with the force help
6118,you it will he sees obiwan younglings  enough a

6132,friend i trust him but the system doesnt show up on the
6133,archive maps
6134,
6135,yoda lost a planet master obiwan has how
6136,embarrassing how embarrassing liam the shades an
6137,interesting puzzle gather younglings around the map
6138,reader clear your minds and find obiwans wayward planet
6139,we will
6140,
6141,the reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the
6142,top the children gather around it obiwan takes out a
6143,little glass ball and places it into the bowl the window
6144,shades close the reader lights up and projects the star
6145,map hologram into the room the children laugh some of
6146,them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars obi
6147,wan walks into the display
6148,
6149,obiwan this is where it ought to be but it isnt
6150,gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to
6151,this spot there should be a star here but there isnt
6152,
6153,yoda most interesting gravitys silhouette remains but
6154,the star and all its planets have disappeared how can this
6155,be now younglings in your mind what is the first thing
6156,you see an answer a thought anyone
6157,
6158,there is a brief pause then a child puts his hand up yoda
6159,nods
6160,
6161,jedi child jack master because someone erased it from the
6162,archive memory
6163,
6164,children thats right yes thats what happened someone
6165,erased it
6166,
6167,jedi child may if the planet blew up the gravity would go
6168,away
6169,
6170,obiwan stares yoda chuckles
6171,
6172,yoda truly wonderful the mind of a child is the padawan
6173,is right go to the center of the gravitys pull and find
6174,your planet you will
6175,
6176,yoda and obiwan move away from the children with a hand
6177,movement obiwan causes the star map to disappear obiwan
6178,uses the force to call the glass ball back to his hand as
6179,the two walk into an adjoining room
6180,
6181,obiwan but master yoda who could have erased information
6182,from the archives thats impossible isnt it
6183,
6184,yoda frowning dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is
6185,only a jedi could have erased those files but who and why
6186,harder to answer meditate on this i will may the force
6187,be with you
6188,
6189,exterior naboo spaceport  day
6190,
6191,the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed
6192,
6193,padmé anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming
6194,from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area they
6195,exit onto the main plaza
6196,
6197,exterior naboo palace grand courtyard  afternoon
6198,

6201,and they see the rosecolored domes of the palace on the 
6202,far side artoo whistles they pick up their gear and start
6203,to cross the courtyard artoo trundles behind them
6204,
6205,anakin if i grew up here i dont think id ever leave
6206,
6207,padmé laughing i doubt that
6208,
6209,anakin no really when i started my training i was very
6210,homesick and very lonely this city and my mom were the
6211,only pleasant things i had to think about the problem
6212,was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt but
6213,i would feel better if i thought about the palace  the way
6214,it shimmers in the sunlight  the way the air always smells
6215,of flowers
6216,
6217,padmé and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls the
6218,first time i saw the capital i was very young id never
6219,seen a waterfall before i thought they were so
6220,beautiful i never dreamed one day id live in the
6221,palace
6222,
6223,anakin well tell me did you dream of power and politics
6224,when you were a little girl
6225,
6226,padmé laughing no that was the last thing i thought of
6227,but the more history i studied the more i realized how
6228,much good politicians could do after school i became a
6229,senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew
6230,it i was elected queen for the most part it was because
6231,of my conviction that reform was possible i wasnt the
6232,youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on
6233,it im not sure i was old enough im not sure i was
6234,ready
6235,
6236,anakin the people you served thought you did a good job i
6237,heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could
6238,stay in office
6239,
6240,padmé popular rule is not democracy annie it gives the
6241,people what they want not what they need and truthfully
6242,i was relieved when my two terms were up so were my
6243,parents they worried about me during the blockade and
6244,couldnt wait for it all to be over actually i was hoping
6245,to have a family by now my sisters have the most
6246,amazing wonderful kids so when the queen asked me to
6247,serve as senator i couldnt refuse her
6248,
6249,anakin i agree i think the republic needs you im glad
6250,you chose to serve i feel things are going to happen in
6251,our generation that will change the galaxy in profound
6252,ways
6253,
6254,padmé i think so too
6255,
6256,anakin and padmé walk toward the palace artoo continues to
6257,follow
6258,
6259,interior naboo palace throne room  afternoon
6260,
6261,queen jamillia is seated on the throne flanked by sio
6262,bibble and a couple of advisors four handmaidens stand
6263,close by and guards are at the doors
6264,
6265,queen jamillia weve been worried about you takes her
6266,hand im so glad youre safe padmé
6267,
6268,padmé thank you your highness i only wish i could have
6269,served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
6270,
6271,sio bibble given the circumstances senator you know it
6272,was the only decision her highness could have made
6273,
6274,queen jamillia how many systems have joined count dooku
6275,and the separatists
6276,
6277,padmé thousands and more are leaving the republic every
6278,day if the senate votes to create an army im sure its
6279,going to push us into a civil war
6280,
6281,sio bibble its unthinkable there hasnt been a full
6282,scale war since the formation of the republic
6283,
6284,queen jamillia do you see any way through negotiations
6285,to bring the separatists back into the republic
6286,
6287,padmé not if they feel threatened the separatists dont
6288,have an army but if they are provoked they will move to
6289,defend themselves im sure of that and with no time or
6290,money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the
6291,commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
6292,
6293,queen jamillia the armies of commerce why has nothing
6294,been done in the senate to restrain them
6295,
6296,padmé im afraid that despite the chancellors best
6297,efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even
6298,senators on the payrolls of the guilds
6299,
6300,sio bibble its outrageous that after all of those
6301,hearings and four trials in the supreme court nute gunray
6302,is still the viceroy of the trade federation i fear the
6303,senate is powerless to resolve this crisis do those money
6304,mongers control everything
6305,
6306,queen jamillia remember counselor the courts were able
6307,to reduce the federations armies thats a move in the
6308,right direction
6309,
6310,padmé there are rumors your highness that the trade
6311,federation army was not reduced as they were ordered
6312,
6313,queen jamillia we must keep our faith in the republic the
6314,day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose
6315,it
6316,
6317,padmé lets pray that day never comes
6318,
6319,queen jamillia in the meantime we must consider your own
6320,safety
6321,
6322,sio bibble signals all the other advisors and attendants
6323,bow and leave the room
6324,
6325,sio bibble to anakin what is your suggestion master
6326,jedi
6327,
6328,padmé anakins not a jedi yet counselor hes still a
6329,padawan learner i was thinking
6330,
6331,anakin nettled hey hold on a minute
6332,
6333,padmé excuse me i was thinking i would stay in the lake
6334,country there are some places up there that are very
6335,isolated
6336,
6337,anakin excuse me i am in charge of security here
6338,mlady
6339,
6340,sio bibble and queen jamillia exchange a look something is
6341,going on here
6342,
6343,padmé annie my life is at risk and this is my home i
6344,know it very well that is why were here i think it
6345,would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in
6346,this instance
6347,
6348,anakin takes a deep breath sorry mlady
6349,
6350,queen jamillia perfect its settled then
6351,

6353,they all start to leave

6706,every day i love the water

6709,desert planet
6710,
6711,padmé becomes aware that anakin is looking at her
6712,
6713,padmé we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry

6724,used to make glass out of sand  and vases and necklaces
6725,out of the glass they were magical
6726,
6727,anakin looks into her eyes everything here is magical
6728,
6729,padmé you could look into the glass and see the water the
6730,way it ripples and moves it looked so real but it

6734,it becomes real
6735,
6736,they look into each others eyes
6737,
6738,padmé i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass

6773,obiwan you mentioned growth acceleration
6774,
6775,lama su oh yes its essential otherwise a mature clone
6776,would take a lifetime to grow now we can do it in half

6788,lama su youll find they are totally obedient taking any
6789,order without question we modified their genetic structure
6790,to make them less independent than the original host 
6791,
6792,obiwan who was the original host
6793,
6794,lama su a bounty hunter called jango fett we felt a jedi
6795,would be the perfect choice but sifodyas handpicked
6796,jango fett himself
6797,

6812,obiwan unaltered
6813,
6814,lama su pure genetic replication no tampering with the
6815,structure to make it more docile and no growth

6838,
6839,padmé are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on
6840,me
6841,

6844,
6845,padmé all right i was twelve his name was palo we
6846,were both in the legislative youth program he was a few
6847,years older then i very cute dark curly hair

6861,one of them smiling i dont think the system works
6862,
6863,padmé how would you have it work
6864,
6865,anakin we need a system where the politicians sit down and
6866,discuss the problem agree whats in the best interests of
6867,all the people and then do it
6868,
6869,padmé that is exactly what we do the trouble is that
6870,people dont always agree in fact they hardly ever do
6871,
6872,anakin then they should be made to
6873,
6874,padmé by whom whos going to make them

6891,
6892,padmé stares at anakin he looks back at her straight
6893,faced but cant hold back a smile

6911,throws more fruit at him he manages to juggle them too
6912,until there are too many and he loses control and ducks
6913,letting food fall on his head they both laugh
6914,
6915,anakin stands in front of a shaak yelling at it and waving

6924,loses his balance and falls off padmé laughs even harder
6925,anakin lies still concerned padmé jumps up and runs to
6926,where anakin is face down in the grass 
6927,
6928,padmé annie annie are you all right
6929,
6930,she turns him over he is pulling a stupid face at her and
6931,laughing she yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him
6932,he catches her arm she struggles they roll over in the
6933,grass embracing and looking into each others eyes
6934,suddenly they become aware of the contact between them
6935,they let go of each other quickly and sit up looking away
6936,
6937,anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her she takes
6938,it he pulls her up and now they are easy together not
6939,selfconscious any more padmé scrambles up onto the shaak
6940,behind anakin she puts her arms around his waist and leans
6941,against his back anakin digs his heels in the shaak

7383,
7384,jango rockets into the air dragging obiwan behind him
7385,along the platform surface as obiwan slides toward some
7386,columns he manages to maneuver himself into a roll avoiding

7388,and pulling himself to his feet obiwan pulls with all his
7389,weight against the momentum of the wire causing jango to
7390,drop and crash into the ground jangos rocketpack breaks

7403,pole stopping his descent he swings and drops onto a
7404,small service platform just above the waves he hauls

9532,machinery count dooku then causes great boulders in the
9533,ceiling above yoda to fall and again yoda deflects the
9534,boulders which fall around him yoda deflects force
9535,lightning thrown at him by the enraged count dooku
9536,

9547,
9548,count dooku it is obvious this contest will not be decided

9553,draws his lightsaber suddenly count dooku charges across

9556,the contest he parries every cut and thrust that count
9557,dooku aims nothing the great swordsman tries gets through
9558,his energy drains his strokes become feeble slower

9560,yoda attacks he flies forward count dooku is forced to
9561,retreat words are insufficient to describe the range and
9562,skill of yodas speed and swordplay his lightsaber his a
9563,humming blur of light finally their blades cross and the
9564,fighting slows

9574,blink of and eye anakin and obiwan attempt to hold up the

11019,
11020,anakin i know the council has grown wary of the chancellors power mine also for that matter arent we all working together to save the republic why all this distrust

11031,
11032,palpatine they will report to me    personally the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war this will bring a quick end to things
11033,
11034,anakin i agree but the jedi council may not see it that way
11035,
11036,palpatine there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security
11037,
11038,anakin with all due respect sir the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments
11039,
11040,palpatine thank you my friend but in this case i have no choice    this war must be won
11041,
11042,anakin everyone will agree on that

11050,anakin what do you mean
11051,
11052,palpatine i fear the jedi the council keeps pushing for more control theyre shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy    ideals i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy
11053,
11054,anakin i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic sir
11055,

11177,
11178,obiwan calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age    its never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is youre too close to the chancellor the council doesnt like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
11179,
11180,anakin i swear to you i didnt ask to be put on the council   
11181,
11182,obiwan but its what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
11183,
11184,anakin that has nothing to do with this
11185,

11187,

11199,
11200,anakin i sense theres more to this talk than youre saying
11201,

11215,

11217,
11218,obiwan this assignment is not to be on record the council asked me to approach you on this personally

11221,

11315,
11316,padme anakin   
11317,
11318,anakin sometimes i wonder whats happening to the jedi order    i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
11319,
11320,padme have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side
11321,
11322,anakin suspicious what do you mean
11323,
11324,padme what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy
11325,
11326,anakin i dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist
11327,
11328,padme anakin this war represents a failure to listen    now youre closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
11329,

11357,
11358,anakin you wanted to see me chancellor
11359,
11360,palpatine yes anakin come closer i have good news our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous he is hiding in the utapau system
11361,
11362,anakin at last well be able to capture that monster and end this war
11363,
11364,palpatine i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didnt select you for this assignment you are the best choice by far � but they cant always be trusted to do the right thing
11365,
11366,anakin they try
11367,
11368,palpatine sit down to his aides leave us
11369,
11370,anakin sits next to palpatine the chancellor leans over to him
11371,
11372,palpatine continuing anakin you know im not able to rely on the jedi council if they havent included you in their plot they soon will
11373,
11374,anakin im not sure i understand
11375,
11376,palpatine you must sense what i have come to suspect    the jedi council want control of the republic    theyre planning to betray me
11377,
11378,anakin i dont think   
11379,
11380,palpatine anakin search your feelings you know dont you
11381,
11382,anakin i know they dont trust you   
11383,
11384,palpatine or the senate    or the republic    or democracy for that matter
11385,
11386,anakin i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken
11387,
11388,palpatine why they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didnt they
11389,
11390,anakin doesnt say anything he simply looks down
11391,
11392,palpatine continuing they asked you to spy on me didnt they
11393,
11394,anakin i dont know  i dont know what to say
11395,
11396,palpatine remember back to your early teachings anakin all those who gain power are afraid to lose it even the jedi
11397,
11398,anakin the jedi use their power for good
11399,
11400,palpatine good is a point of view anakin and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the jedi to be  
11401,
11402,anakin    evil
11403,
11404,palpatine    from a jedis point of view the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force that is why they are more powerful
11405,
11406,anakin the sith rely on their passion for their strength they think inward only about themselves
11407,
11408,palpatine and the jedi dont
11409,
11410,anakin the jedi are selfless    they only care about others
11411,
11412,palpatine smiles
11413,
11414,palpatine or so youve been trained to believe why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong
11415,
11416,anakin im not sure its wrong
11417,
11418,palpatine have they asked you to betray the jedi code the constitution a friendship your own values think consider their motives keep your mind clear of assumptions the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith
11419,
11420,anakin is deep in thought
11421,
11422,palpatine continuing did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
11423,
11424,anakin no
11425,
11426,palpatine i thought not its not a story the jedi would tell you its a sith legend darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying
11427,
11428,anakin he could actually save people from death
11429,
11430,palpatine the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
11431,
11432,anakin what happened to him
11433,
11434,palpatine he became so powerful    the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep smiles plagueis never saw it coming its ironic he could save others from death but not himself
11435,
11436,anakin is it possible to learn this power

13780, biggs just now  i wanted to surprise you hot shot  i thought youd be here certainly didnt expect you to be out working 
13781, luke the academy didnt change you much but youre back so soon  hey what happened didnt you get your commission
13782, biggs of course i got it  signed aboard the rand ecliptic last week  first mate biggs darklighter at your service i just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons
13783, luke i almost forgot  theres a battle going on  right here in our system  come and look
13784, deak not again  forget it
13785, luke there they are
13786, biggs thats no battle hot shot theyre just sitting there  probably a freightertanker refueling

13788, luke hey easy with those
13789, camie dont worry about it wormie
13790, fixer i keep telling you the rebellion is a long way from here  i doubt if the empire would even fight to keep this system  believe me luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing

13792, vader dont play games with me your highness  you werent on any mercy mission this time  you passed directly through a restricted system  several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies  i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you
13793, leia i dont know what youre talking about  im a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan
13794, vader youre a part of the rebel alliance and a traitor  take her away
13795, commander holding her is dangerous  if word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate
13796, vader i have traced the rebel spies to her  now she is my only link to find their secret base
13797, commander you anything
13798, vader leave that to me  send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed
13799, second officer lord vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship  and no transmissions were made  an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard
13800, vader she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod  send a detachment down to retrieve them  see to it personally commander  therell be no one to stop us this time
13801, commander yes sir
13802, threepio how did i get into this mess  i really dont know how  we seem to be made to suffer  its our lot in life
13803, threepio ive got to rest before i fall apart  my joints are almost frozen 
13804, threepio what a desolate place this is
13805, threepio where are you going
13806, threepio well im not going that way  its much too rocky  this way is much easier
13807, threepio what makes you think there are settlements over there
13808, threepio dont get technical with me
13809, threepio what mission  what are you talking about  ive had just about enough of you  go that way  youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile
13810, threepio and dont let me catch you following me begging for help because you wont get it
13811, threepio no more adventures  im not going that way
13812, threepio that malfunctioning little twerp  this is all his fault  he tricked me into going this way but hell do no better
13813, threepio wait whats that  a transport  im saved
13814, threepio over here  help  please help
13815, luke  so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on deaks trail  i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad  uncle owen was pretty upset  he grounded me for the rest of the season  you should have been there it was fantastic
13816, biggs you ought to take it a little easy luke  you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley but those little skyhoppers are dangerous  keep it up and one day whammo youre going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall
13817, luke look whos talking  now that youve been around those giant starships youre beginning to sound like my uncle youve gotten soft in the city
13818, biggs ive missed you kid
13819, luke well things havent been the same since you left biggs  its been soquiet
13820, biggs luke i didnt come back just to say goodbye  i shouldnt tell you this but youre the only one i can trust and if i dont come back i want somebody to know
13821, luke what are you talking about
13822, biggs i made some friends at the academy  when our frigate goes to one of the central systems were going to jump ship and join the alliance
13823, luke join the rebellion  are you kidding  how
13824, biggs quiet down will ya  you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater
13825, luke im sorry  im quiet listen how quiet i am  you can barely hear me
13826, biggs my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact
13827, luke around forever trying to find them
13828, biggs i know its a long shot but if i dont find them ill do what i can on my own  its what we always talked about  luke im not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service  the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side  the side i believe in 
13829, luke and im stuck here
13830, biggs i thought you were going to the academy next term  youll get your chance to get off this rock
13831, luke not likely  i had to cancel my application  there has been a lot of unrest among the sand people since you left theyve even raided the outskirts of anchorhead
13832, biggs your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sand people with one blaster
13833, luke i know but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off  he needs me for just one more season  i cant leave him now
13834, biggs i feel for you luke youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important  what good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the empire  you know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systemsit wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the empire
13835, luke it couldnt happen here  you said it yourself  the empire wont bother with this rock
13836, biggs things always change
13837, luke i wish i was going  are you going to be around long 
13838, biggs no im leaving in the morning
13839, luke then i guess i wont see you
13840, biggs maybe someday  ill keep a lookout

13853, threepio sir  not in an environment such as this  thats why ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that
13854, owen what i really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators
13855, threepio vaporators  sir  my first job was programming binary load lifters very similar to your vaporators  you could say
13856, owen do you speak bocce
13857, threepio of course i can sir  its like a second language for me  im as fluent in bocce
13858, owen all right shut up ill take this one

13877, threepio thank the maker  this oil bath is going to feel so good  ive got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move
13878, luke it just isnt fair  oh biggs is right  im never gonna get out of here
13879, threepio is there anything i might do to help 
13880, luke well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock
13881, threepio i dont think so sir  im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things  not on this planet anyways  as a matter of fact im not even sure which planet im on

13891, luke you know of the rebellion against the empire
13892, threepio thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir
13893, luke have you been in many battles
13894, threepio several i think  actually theres not much to tell  im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories  well not at making them interesting anyways

13896, leia help me obiwan kenobi  youremy only hope

13904, threepio i think she was a passenger on our last voyage  a person of some importance sir  i believe  our captain was attached to
13905, luke is there more to this recording
13906, threepio behave yourself artoo  youre going to get us in trouble  its all right you can trust him  hes our new master
13907, threepio he says hes the property of obiwan kenobi a resident of these parts  and its a private message for him  quite frankly sir i dont know what hes talking about  our last master was captain antilles but with what weve been through this little r unit has become a bit eccentric
13908, luke obiwan kenobi  i wonder if he means old ben kenobi
13909, threepio i beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about
13910, luke well i dont know anyone named obiwan but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea  hes kind of a strange old hermit
13911, luke i wonder who she is  it sounds like shes in trouble  id better play back the whole thing
13912, threepio he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system  he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
13913, luke hm  oh yeah well i guess youre too small to run away on me if i take this off  okay
13914, luke there you go
13915, luke well wait a minute  whered she go  bring her back  play back the entire message
13916, threepio been playing  the one youre carrying inside your rusty innards 
13917, aunt beru luke  luke  come to dinner
13918, luke all right ill be right there aunt beru
13919, threepio im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
13920, luke well see what you can do with him  ill be right back
13921, threepio just you reconsider playing that message for him
13922, threepio no i dont think he likes you at all
13923, threepio no i dont like you either
13924, luke you know i think that r unit we bought might have been stolen
13925, owen what makes you think that
13926, luke well i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him  he says he belongs to someone called obiwan kenobi
13927, luke i thought he might have meant ben  do you know what hes talking about  well i wonder if hes related to ben
13928, owen that old mans just a crazy wizard  tomorrow i want you to take that r unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed  thatll be the end of it  it belongs to us now
13929, luke but what if this obiwan comes looking for him
13930, owen he wont i dont think he exists any more  he died about the same time as your father
13931, luke he knew my father
13932, owen i told you to forget it  your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow  in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers
13933, luke yes sir  i think those new droids are going to work out fine  in fact i uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season  and if these new droids do work out i want to transmit my application to the academy this year
13934, owen you mean the next semester before harvest
13935, luke sure therere more than enough droids
13936, owen harvest is when i need you the most  only one more season  this year well make enough on the harvest so ill be able to hire some more hands  and then you can go to the academy next year
13937, owen you must understand i need you here luke
13938, luke but its a whole nother year
13939, owen look its only one more season
13940, luke yeah thats what you said last year when biggs and tank left

13949, luke oh no
13950, threepio that r unit has always been a problem  these astrodroids are getting quite out of hand  even i cant understand their logic at times 
13951, luke how could i be so stupid  hes nowhere in sight  blast it
13952, threepio pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him
13953, luke its too dangerous with all the sand people around  well have to wait until morning
13954, owen luke im shutting the power down for the night
13955, luke all right ill be there in a few minutes  boy am i gonna get it

13957, threepio oh he excels at that sir
13958, owen luke  luke  luke  where could he be loafing now
13959, owen have you seen luke this morning
13960, aunt beru he said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early
13961, owen uh  did he take those two new droids with him
13962, aunt beru i think so
13963, owen well hed better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or therell be hell to pay
13964, luke hows that
13965, luke old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but i dont see how that r unit could have come this far  we must have missed him  uncle owen isnt going to take this very well
13966, threepio sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
13967, luke sure  he needs you  hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so
13968, threepio deactivate  well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt
13969, luke wait theres something dead ahead on the scanner  it looks like our droid hit the accelerator
13970, luke hey whoa just where do you think youre going
13971, threepio master luke here is your rightful owner  well have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish and dont talk to me of your mission either  youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here
13972, luke well come on its getting late  i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up
13973, threepio if you dont mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop
13974, luke no hes not going to try anything
13975, luke whats wrong with him now
13976, threepio oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
13977, luke sand people  or worse  come on lets have a look  come on
13978, luke there are two banthas down there but i dont see any wait a second theyre sand people all right  i can see one of them now
13979, ben hello there  come here my little friend  dont be afraid
13980, ben dont worry hell be all right
13981, luke what happened
13982, ben rest easy son youve had a busy day  youre fortunate youre still in one piece
13983, luke ben  ben kenobi  boy am i glad to see you 
13984, ben the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly  tell me young luke what brings you out this far
13985, luke oh this little droid  i think hes searching for his former master  ive never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems tobe no stopping him  he claims to be the property of an obiwan kenobi  is he a relative of yours  do you know who hes talking about
13986, ben obiwan kenobi obiwan  now thats a name i havent heard in a long time a long time
13987, luke i think my uncle knew him  he said he was dead
13988, ben oh hes not dead no not yet
13989, luke you know him
13990, ben well of course of course i know him  hes me  i havent gone by the name obiwan since oh before you were born
13991, luke then the droid does belong to you
13992, ben dont seem to remember ever owning a droid  very interesting 
13993, ben i think we better get indoors  the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
13994, luke  threepio
13995, threepio where am i  i must have taken a bad step
13996, luke can you stand  weve got to get out of here before the sand people return
13997, threepio i dont think i can make it  you go on master luke  theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account  im done for
13998, luke no youre not  what kind of talk is that
13999, ben quickly son theyre on the move
14000, luke no my father didnt fight in the wars  he was a navigator on a spice freighter
14001, ben thats what your uncle told you  he didnt hold with your fathers ideals  thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
14002, luke you fought in the clone wars
14003, ben yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father
14004, luke i wish id known him
14005, ben he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior  i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself  and he was a good friend  which reminds me
14006, ben i have something here for you  your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it  he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did 
14007, threepio sir if youll not be needing me ill close down for awhile
14008, luke sure go ahead
14009, luke what is it
14010, ben your fathers lightsaber  this is the weapon of a jedi knight  not as clumsy or as random as a blaster
14011, ben an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time  for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic  before the dark times before the empire
14012, luke how did my father die
14013, ben a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights  he betrayed and murdered your father  now the jedi are all but extinct  vader was seduced by the dark side of the force
14014, luke the force
14015, ben well the force is what gives the jedi his power  its an energy field created by all living things  it surrounds us and penetrates us  it binds the galaxy together
14016, ben now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend  and where you come from
14017, luke i saw part of the message he was
14018, ben i seem to have found it
14019, leia general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars  now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire  i regret that i am unable to present my fathers request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and im afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed  i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r unit  my father will know how to retrieve it  you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan  this is our most desperate hour  help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope
14020, ben you must learn the ways of the force if youre to come with me to alderaan
14021, luke alderaan  im not going to alderaan  ive got to go home  its late im in for it as it is
14022, ben i need your help luke  im getting too old for this sort of thingshe needs your help
14023, luke i cant get involved  ive got work to do  its not that i like the empire  i hate it  but theres nothing i can do about it right now  its such a long way from here
14024, ben thats your uncle talking
14025, luke oh god my uncle  how am i ever going to explain this
14026, ben learn about the force luke
14027, luke look i can take you as far as anchorhead  you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever youre going
14028, ben you must do what you feel is right of course
14029, tagge until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable  the rebel alliance is too well equipped  theyre more dangerous than you realize
14030, motti dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station
14031, tagge the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate as long as
14032, tarkin the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us  ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently  the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away
14033, tagge thats impossible  how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy
14034, tarkin the regional governors now have direct control over territories  fear will keep the local systems in line  fear of this battle station
14035, tagge and what of the rebellion  if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it
14036, vader the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands
14037, motti any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data theyve obtained  this station is now the ultimate power in the universe  i suggest we use it
14038, vader dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed  the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force
14039, motti dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways lord vader  your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fort
14040, vader i find your lack of faith disturbing
14041, tarkin enough of this  vader release him
14042, vader as you wish
14043, tarkin this bickering is pointless  lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational  we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke
14044, luke it looks like sand people did this all right  look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks  its just i never heard of them hitting anything this big before
14045, ben they didnt  but we are meant to think they did  these tracks are side by side  sand people always ride single file to hide there numbers
14046, luke these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio
14047, ben and these blast points too accurate for sand people  only imperial stormtroopers are so precise
14048, luke why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas
14049, luke if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to  and that would lead them back home
14050, ben wait luke  its too dangerous
14051, luke uncle owen  aunt beru  uncle owen
14052, vader and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base
14053, ben theres nothing you could have done luke had you been there  youd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire
14054, luke i want to come with you to alderaan  theres nothing here for me now  i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father
14055, ben mos eisley spaceport  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy  we must be cautious
14056, trooper how long have you had these droids
14057, luke about three or four seasons
14058, ben theyre for sale if you want them
14059, trooper let me see your identification
14060, ben you dont need to see his identification
14061, trooper we dont need to see his identification
14062, ben looking for
14063, trooper these are not the droids were looking for
14064, ben he can go about his business
14065, trooper you can go about your business
14066, ben move along
14067, trooper move along  move along
14068, threepio i cant abide these jawas  disgusting creatures
14069, luke go on go on  i cant understand how we got by those troopers  i thought we were dead
14070, ben the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded  you will find it a powerful ally
14071, luke do you really think were going to find a pilot here thatll take us to alderaan
14072, ben well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here  only watch your step  this place can be a little rough
14073, luke im ready for anything
14074, threepio come along artoo
14075, bartender we dont serve their kind here
14076, luke what
14077, bartender your droids theyll have to wait outside  we dont want them here
14078, luke listen why dont you wait out by the speeder  we dont want any trouble
14079, threepio i heartily agree with you sir
14080, creature negola dewaghi wooldugger
14081, human he doesnt like you
14082, luke im sorry
14083, human i dont like you either
14084, human dont insult us  you just watch yourself  were wanted men  i have the death sentence on twelve systems
14085, luke ill be careful than
14086, human youll be dead
14087, ben this little one isnt worth the effort  come let me buy you something
14088, bartender no blasters  no blaster
14089, ben this is chewbacca  hes firstmate on a ship that might suit our needs
14090, threepio i dont like the look of this
14091, han han solo  im captain of the millennium falcon  chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the alderaan system
14092, ben yes indeed  if its a fast ship
14093, han fast ship  youve never heard of the millennium falcon
14094, ben should i have
14095, han its the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
14096, han ive outrun imperial starships not the local bulkcruisers mind you  im talking about the big corellian ships now  shes fast enough for you old man  whats the cargo
14097, ben only passengers  myself the boy two droids and no questions asked
14098, han what is it  some kind of local trouble
14099, ben lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements
14100, han well thats the real trick isnt it  and its going to cost you something extra  ten thousand in advance
14101, luke ten thousand  we could almost buy our own ship for that
14102, han but whos going to fly it kid  you
14103, luke you bet i could  im not such a bad pilot myself  we dont have to sit here and listen
14104, ben we havent that much with us  but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
14105, han seventeen huh
14106, han okay  you guys got yourself a ship  well leave as soon as youre ready  docking bay ninetyfour
14107, ben ninetyfour
14108, han looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
14109, trooper all right well check it out
14110, han seventeen thousand  those guys must really be desperate  this could really save my neck  get back to the ship and get her ready
14111, ben youll have to sell your speeder
14112, luke thats okay  im never coming back to this planet again
14113, greedo going somewhere solo
14114, han yes greedo  as a matter of fact i was just going to see your boss  tell jabba that ive got his money
14115, greedo its too late  you should have paid him when you had the chance  jabbas put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you  im lucky i found you first
14116, han yeah but this time i got the money
14117, greedo if you give it to me i might forget i found you
14118, han i dont have it with me  tell jabba
14119, greedo jabbas through with you  he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser
14120, han even i get boarded sometimes  do you think i had a choice
14121, greedo you can tell that to jabba  he may only take your ship
14122, han over my dead body
14123, greedo thats the idea ive been looking forward to killing you for a long time
14124, han yes ill bet you have
14125, han sorry about the mess
14126, vader her resistance to the mind probe is considerable  it will be some time before we can extract any information from her
14127, imperial officer the final checkout is complete  all systems are operational  what course shall we set
14128, tarkin perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion
14129, vader what do you mean
14130, tarkin i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this stationset your course for princess leias home planet of alderaan
14131, trooper with pleasure
14132, threepio lock the door artoo
14133, trooper all right check that side of the street  its secure  move on to the next door
14134, threepio i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you  i dont know what all this trouble is about but im sure it must be your fault
14135, threepio you watch your language
14136, luke he says its the best he can do  since the xp came out they 
14137, ben it will be enough
14138, ben if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well
14139, jabba come on out solo
14140, han ive been waiting for you jabba
14141, jabba i expected you would be
14142, han im not the type to run
14143, jabba han my boy there are times when you disappoint me why havent you paid me  and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that after all weve been through together
14144, han you sent greedo to blast me
14145, jabba han why youre the best smuggler in the business  youre too valuable to fry  he was only relaying my concern at your delays  he wasnt going to blast you
14146, han i think he thought he was  next time dont send one of those twerps  if youve got something to say to me come see me yourself
14147, jabba han han  if only you hadnt had to dump that shipment of spice you understand i just cant make an exception  where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship  its not good business
14148, han you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba  i had no choice but ive gota charter now and i can pay you back plus a little extra  i just need some more time
14149, jabba put your blasters away  han my boy im only doing this because youre the best and i need you  so for an extra say twenty percent ill give you a little more time but this is it  if you disappoint me again ill put a price on your head so large you wont be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life
14150, han jabba ill pay you because its my pleasure
14151, luke what a piece of junk
14152, han shell make point five beyond the speed of light  she may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid  ive added some special modifications myself
14153, han were a little rushed so if youll hurry aboard well get out of here
14154, threepio hello sir
14155, trooper which way
14156, trooper all right men  load your weapons
14157, trooper stop that ship
14158, trooper blast em
14159, han chewie get us out of here
14160, threepio oh my  id forgotten how much i hate space travel
14161, han it looks like an imperial cruiser  our passengers must be hotter than i thought  try and hold them off  angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed
14162, han stay sharp  there are two more coming in theyre going to try to cut us off
14163, luke why dont you outrun them  i thought you said this thing was fast
14164, han watch your mouth kid or youre going to find yourself floating home  well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace  besides i know a few maneuvers well lose them
14165, han heres where the fun begins
14166, ben how long before you can make the jump to light speed
14167, han itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer
14168, luke are you kidding  at the rate theyre gaining
14169, han traveling through hyperspace isnt like dusting crops boy  without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick wouldnt it
14170, luke whats that flashing
14171, han were losing our deflector shield  go strap yourself in im going to make the jump to light speed
14172, motti weve entered the alderaan system
14173, leia governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vaders leash  i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board
14174, tarkin charming to the last  you dont know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life
14175, leia to take the responsibility yourself
14176, tarkin princess leia before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational  no star system will dare oppose the emperor now
14177, leia the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers
14178, tarkin not after we demonstrate the power of this station  in a way you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first  since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base i have chosen to test this stations destructive power on your home planet of alderaan
14179, leia no  alderaan is peaceful  we have no weapons  you cant possibly
14180, tarkin you would prefer another target  a military target  then name the system
14181, tarkin i grow tired of asking this  so itll be the last time  where is the rebel base
14182, leia dantooine
14183, leia theyre on dantooine
14184, tarkin there  you see lord vader she can be reasonable continue with the operation  you may fire when ready
14185, leia what
14186, tarkin youre far too trusting  dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration  but dont worry  we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough 
14187, leia no
14188, vader commence primary ignition
14189, luke are you all right  whats wrong
14190, ben i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced  i fear something terrible has happened
14191, ben youd better get on with your exercises
14192, han well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  i told you id outrun em
14193, han dont everyone thank me at once
14194, han anyway we should be at alderaan about ohtwohundred hours
14195, threepio now be careful artoo
14196, threepio he made a fair move  screaming about it wont help you
14197, han let him have it its not wise to upset a wookiee
14198, threepio but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
14199, han thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose  wookiees are known to do that
14200, threepio i see your point sir  i suggest a new strategy artoo  let the wookiee win
14201, ben remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him
14202, luke you mean it controls your actions
14203, ben partially but it also obeys your commands
14204, han hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid
14205, luke you dont believe in the force do you
14206, han kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  ive seen a lot of strange stuff but ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one allpowerful force controlling everything  theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny
14207, han its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
14208, ben i suggest you try it again luke
14209, ben this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct
14210, luke with the blast shield down i cant even see  how am i supposed to fight
14211, ben your eyes can deceive you  dont trust them
14212, ben stretch out with your feelings
14213, ben you see you can do it
14214, han i call it luck 
14215, ben in my experience theres no such thing as luck
14216, han look going good against remotes is one thing  going good against the living  thats something else
14217, han looks like were coming up on alderaan
14218, luke you know i did feel something  i could almost see the remote
14219, ben thats good  you have taken your first step into a larger world
14220, tarkin yes
14221, officer cass our scout ships have reached dantooine  they found the remains of a rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time  they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems
14222, tarkin she lied  she lied to us
14223, vader i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion
14224, tarkin terminate her immediately
14225, han stand by chewie here we go  cut in the sublight engines
14226, han what the  aw weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower  some kind of asteroid collision  its not on any of the charts
14227, luke whats going on
14228, han our position is correct except no alderaan
14229, luke what do you mean  where is it
14230, han thats what im trying to tell you kid  it aint there  its been totally blown away
14231, luke what  how
14232, ben destroyed by the empire
14233, han the entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet  itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than ive
14234, han theres another ship coming in
14235, luke maybe they know what happened
14236, ben its an imperial fighter
14237, luke it followed us
14238, ben no  its a short range fighter
14239, han there arent any bases around here  where did it come from
14240, luke it sure is leaving in a big hurry  if they identify us were in big trouble
14241, han not if i can help it  chewie jam its transmissions
14242, ben itd be as well to let it go  its too far out of range
14243, han not for long
14244, ben a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own
14245, luke then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something
14246, han well he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
14247, luke look at him  hes heading for that small moon
14248, han i think i can get him before he gets there hes almost in range
14249, ben thats no moon  its a space station
14250, han its too big to be a space station
14251, luke i have a very bad feeling about this
14252, ben turn the ship around
14253, han yeah i think your right  full reverse  chewie lock in the auxiliary power
14254, luke why are we still moving towards it
14255, han were caught in a tractor beam  its pulling us in
14256, luke but theres gotta be something you can do
14257, han theres nothin i can do about it kid  im in full power  im going to have to shut down  but theyre not going to get me without a fight
14258, ben you cant win  but there are alternatives to fighting
14259, voice over death star intercom clear bay twentythreeseven  we are opening the magnetic field
14260, officer to your stations
14261, officer come with me
14262, officer close all outboard shields  close all outboard shields
14263, tarkin yes
14264, voice weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system  its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley
14265, vader they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess  she may yet be of some use to us
14266, voice unlock onefiveseven and nine release charges
14267, officer theres no one on board sir  according to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff  it must be a decoy sir  several of the escape pods have been jettisoned
14268, vader did you find any droids
14269, officer no sir  if there were any on board they must also have jettisoned
14270, vader send a scanning crew on board  i want every part of this ship checked
14271, officer yes sir
14272, vader i sense something a presence i havent felt since
14273, officer get me a scanning crew in here on the double  i want every part of this ship checked
14274, luke boy its lucky you had these compartments
14275, han i use them for smuggling  i never thought id be smuggling myself in them  this is ridiculous  even if i could take off id never get past the tractor beam
14276, ben leave that to me
14277, han damn fool i knew that you were going to say that
14278, ben whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him
14279, trooper the ships all yours  if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately  all right lets go
14280, han hey down there could you give us a hand with this
14281, gantry officer txfouronetwo  why arent you at your post  txfouronetwo do you copy 
14282, gantry officer take over  weve got a bad transmitter  ill see what i can do
14283, luke you know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here
14284, han bring them on  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
14285, threepio we found the computer outlet sir

14530, han not a bad bit of rescuing huh  you know sometimes i even amaze myself
14531, leia that doesnt sound too hard  besides they let us go  its the only explanation for the ease of our escape
14532, han easy you call that easy

14534, han not this ship sister
14535, leia at least the information in artoo is still intact
14536, han whats so important  whats he carrying
14537, leia the technical readouts of that battle station  i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found  its not over yet
14538, han it is for me sister  look i aint in this for your revolution and im not in it for you princess  i expect to be well paid  im in it for the money
14539, leia you neednt worry about your reward  if money is all that you love then thats what youll receive
14540, leia your friend is quite a mercenary  i wonder if he really cares about anything or anyone

14543, han im trying not to kid
14544, luke good

14546, luke no
14547, willard youre safe  we had feared the worst
14548, willard when we heard about alderaan we were afraid that you were lost along with your father
14549, leia we dont have time for our sorrows commander  the battle station has surely tracked us hereits the only explanation for the ease of our escape  you must use the information in this r unit to plan the attack  it is our only hope
14550, tarkin yes
14551, death star intercom voice we are approaching the planet yavin  the rebel base is on a moon on the far side  we are preparing to orbit the planet
14552, dodonna the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleetits defenses are designed around a direct largescale assault  a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense
14553, gold leader pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that
14554, dodonna well the empire doesnt consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat or theyd have a tighter defense  an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station
14555, dodonna the approach will not be easy  you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point  the target area is only two meters wide  its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port  the shaft leads directly to the reactor system  a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station
14556, dodonna only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction  the shaft is rayshielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes
14557, wedge thats impossible even for a computer
14558, luke its not impossible  i used to bullseye womp rats in my tsixteen back home  theyre not much bigger than two meters
14559, dodonna man your ships  and may the force be with you
14560, death star intercom voice orbiting the planet at maximum velocity  the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes
14561, vader this will be a day long remembered  it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion
14562, man all flight troops man your stations  all flight troops man your stations
14563, luke so you got your reward and youre just leaving then
14564, han thats right yeah  i got some old debts ive got to pay off with this stuff  even if i didnt you dont think id be fool enough to stick around here do you  why dont you come with us  youre pretty good in a fight  i could use you
14565, luke come on  why dont you take a look around  you know whats about to happen what theyre up against  they could use a good pilot like you  youre turning your back on them
14566, han what goods a reward if you aint around to use it  besides attacking that battle station aintmy idea of courage  its more like suicide
14567, luke all right  well take care of yourself han guess thats what youre best at isnt it
14568, han hey luke may the force be with you
14569, han whatre you lookin at  i know what im doing

15430, leia so youre part of the mining guild then
15431, lando no not actually our operation is small enough not to be  noticedwhich is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves
15432, han arent you afraid the empires going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down
15433, lando thats always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything weve built here but things have developed that will insure security ive just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever

15475, vader good monitor skywalker and allow him to land
15476, lando lord vader we only use this facility for carbon freezing if  you put him in there it might kill him

15802, vader yes my master
15803, emperor patience my friend in time he will seek you out and when he does you must bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force
15804, vader as you wish
15805, emperor everything is proceeding as i have foreseen
15806, yoda hmm that face you make look i so old to young eyes
15807, luke no of course not
15808, yoda i do yes i do  sick have i become old and weak  when nine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not hmm
15809, yoda soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have
15810, luke master yoda you cant die
15811, yoda strong am i with the force but not that strong twilight is upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of things  the way of the force
15812, luke but i need your help ive come back to complete the training
15813, yoda no more training do you require already know you that which you need
15814, luke then i am a jedi
15815, yoda ohhh not yet one thing remains vader you must confront vader then only then a jedi will you be and confront him you will
15816, luke master yoda is darth vader my father
15817, yoda mmm rest i need yes rest
15818, luke yoda i must know
15819, yoda your father he is
15820, yoda told you did he
15821, luke yes
15822, yoda unexpected this is and unfortunate
15823, luke unfortunate that i know the truth
15824, yoda no unfortunate that you rushed to face him that incomplete was your training not ready for the burden were you
15825, luke well im sorry
15826, yoda remember a jedis strength flows from the force  but beware  anger fear aggression the dark side are they  once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny
15827, yoda lukelukedo notdo not underestimate the powers of the emperor or suffer your fathers fate you will luke when gone am i  the last of the jedi will you be luke the force runs strong in your family pass on what you have learned luke  there is anotherskyskywalker
15828, luke i cant do it artoo i cant go on alone
15829, ben yoda will always be with you
15830, luke obiwan why didnt you tell me
15831, luke you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father
15832, ben you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view
15833, luke a certain point of view
15834, ben luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view
15835, ben i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault
15836, ben anakin was a good friend
15837, ben when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him  i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi  i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda  i was wrong  my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy
15838, luke theres still good in him
15839, ben i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil
15840, luke i cant do it ben
15841, ben you cannot escape your destiny
15842, luke i tried to stop him once i couldnt do it
15843, ben vader humbled you when first you met him lukebut that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience  had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared
15844, luke but i had to help my friends
15845, ben and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear
15846, luke i found out darth vader was my father
15847, ben to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door  for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again
15848, luke i cant kill my own father
15849, ben then the emperor has already won you were our only hope
15850, luke yoda spoke of another
15851, ben the other he spoke of is your twin sister
15852, luke but i have no sister
15853, ben hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous
15854, luke leia leias my sister
15855, ben your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor
15856, ben when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible  so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan
15857, ben the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy  even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well  thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause  thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate
15858, luke but you cant let her get involved now ben vader will destroy her
15859, ben she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke  but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader
15860, han well look at you a general huh
15861, lando oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab
15862, han well dont look at me pal i just said you were a fair pilot i didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack
15863, lando im surprised they didnt ask you to do it
15864, han well who says they didnt  but i aint crazy youre the respectable one remember
15865, mon mothma the emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come
15866, mon mothma the data brought to us by the bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the emperors new battle station we also know that the weapon systems of this death star are not yet operational with the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected but most important of all weve learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star
15867, mon mothma many bothans died to bring us this information admiral ackbar please
15868, ackbar you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational the death star does have a strong defense mechanism it is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor
15869, ackbar general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
15870, han good luck

27892,galen erso saw if you’re watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the alliance perhaps there’s a chance to explain myself and though i don’t dare hope for too much a chance for jyn if she’s alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately i’ve missed her jyn my stardust i can’t imagine what you think of me when i was taken i faced some bitter truths i was told that soon enough krennic would have you as well as time went by i knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you i knew if i refused to work if i took my own life it would only be a matter of time before krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project so i did the one thing that nobody expected i lied i learned to lie i played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work i made myself indispensable and all the while i laid the groundwork of my revenge we call it the death star there is no better name and the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed i’ve placed a weakness deep within the system a flaw so small and powerful they’ll never find it but jyn jyn if you’re listening my beloved so much of my life has been wasted i try to think of you only in the moments when i’m strong because the pain of not having you with me your mother our family the pain of that loss is so overwhelming i risk failing even now it’s just so hard not to think of you think of where you are my stardust saw the reactor module that’s the key that’s the place i’ve laid my trap it’s well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station
