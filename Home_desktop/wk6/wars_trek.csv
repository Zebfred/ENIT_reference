1,powerhe is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption a
1,manufactured scandal surrounds him the bureaucrats are in charge now
1,amidala  what options do we have
1,palpatine  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
1,supreme chancellor one who will take control of the bureaucrats enforces
1,the laws and give us justice you could call for a vote of no confidence
1,in chancellor valorum
1,amidala  he has been our strongest supporter is there any other way
1,palpatine  our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
1,courts
1,amidala  theres no time for that the courts take even longer to decide
1,things than the senate our people are dying senatormore and more each
1,day we must do something quickly to stop the federation

1,palpatine this grievous blow is especially personal to me
1,before i became chancellor i served amidala when she was
1,queen she was a great leader who fought for justice not
1,only here in this honorable assembly but also on her home
1,planet she was so loved she could have been elected queen
1,for life she believed in public service and she fervently
1,believed in democracy her death is a great loss to us all

1,freedom and as a dear friend

1,padm  less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was
1,made against my life one of my bodyguards and six others
1,were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered i was the target
1,but more importantly i believe this security measure
1,before you was the target i have led the opposition to
1,build an army but there is someone in this body who will
1,stop at nothing to assure its passage
1,many of the senators boo and yell at senator amidala
1,padm  i warn you if you vote to create this army war
1,will follow i have experienced the misery of war
1,firsthand i do not wish to do it again
1,there is sporadic yelling for and against her statements
1,padm  wake up senators you must wake up if we offer
1,the separatists violence they can only show us violence in
1,return many will lose their lives all will lose their
1,freedom this decision could very well destroy the very
1,foundation of our great republic i pray you do not let
1,fear push you into a disastrous decision vote down this
1,security measure which is nothing less than a declaration
1,of war does anyone here want that i cannot believe they
1,do
1,there is an undercurrent of booing and groaning senator
1,orn free taa moves his pod next to amidala
1,orn free taa my motion to defer the vote must be dealt
1,with first that is the rule of law

1,padm  but i think that count dooku was behind it
1,there is a stir of surprise they look at one another
1,kiadimundi he is a political idealist not a murderer
1,mace windu you know mlady count dooku was once a jedi
1,he couldnt assassinate anyone its not in his character
1,yoda in dark times nothing is what it appears to be but
1,the fact remains for certain senator in grave danger you

1,palpatine situation is that serious no but i do
1,senator
1,padm  chancellor please i dont want any more guards
1,palpatine i realize all too well that additional security
1,might be disruptive for you but perhaps someone you are
1,familiar with an old friend like master kenobi
1,palpatine nods to mace windu who nods back
1,mace windu thats possible he has just returned from a
1,border dispute on ansion

1,anakin vo shes not like the others in the senate
1,master
1,obiwan vo its been my experience that senators are

1,straight at it crashing through the blinds as he goes
1,through the window

1,obiwan flies through the glass window and flings himself
1,at the probe droid grabbing onto the deadly machine before

1,wan but manages to stay afloat and fly away with the jedi
1,hanging on for dear life a hundred stories above the city
1,interior apartment building amidalas apartment  night

1,padm  nods yes
1,exterior cityscape coruscant  night
1,the probe droid sends several protective electrical shocks
1,across its surface causing obiwan to almost lose his
1,grip as they dart in and out of the speeder traffic obi
1,wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid its power
1,shuts off obiwan and the droid drop like rocks obiwan
1,realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire
1,back the droids systems light up again and it takes off 
1,exterior senate apartments  entrance  night
1,anakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of
1,parked speeders he vaults into an open one and takes off
1,gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high
1,above
1,exterior cityscape coruscant  night
1,the droid bumps against a wall hoping to knock the jedi
1,loose it moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him
1,it takes the jedi wildly between buildings and finally
1,skims across a rooftop as obiwan is forced to lift his
1,legs tenaciously hanging onto the droid the droid heads
1,for a dirty beatup speeder hidden in an alcove of a
1,building about twenty stories up when the pilot of the
1,speeder the scruffy bounty hunter zam wesell sees the
1,droid approach with obiwan hanging on she pulls a long
1,rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the jedi
1,explosions burst all around obiwan zam runs to her
1,speeder jumps in and takes off
1,obiwan i have a bad feeling about this
1,finally the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up obi
1,wan falls fifty stories until a speeder drops down next to
1,him and he manages to grab onto the back end of the
1,speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit the jedi
1,struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open
1,speeder and sit down next to the driver anakin
1,anakin that was wacky i almost lost you in the traffic
1,obiwan what took you so long
1,anakin oh you know master i couldnt find a speeder i
1,really liked with an open cockpit and with the right
1,speed capabilities and then you know i had to get a
1,really gonzo color
1,they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam as she fires out the
1,open window at them with her laser pistol
1,obiwan if youd spend as much time working on your saber
1,skills as you do on your wit young padawan you would
1,rival master yoda as a swordsman
1,anakin i thought i already did
1,obiwan only in your mind my very young apprentice
1,careful hey easy
1,as this conversation is going on anakin deftly moves in
1,and out of the oncoming traffic across lanes between
1,buildings and miraculously through a construction site
1,zam wesell continues firing at them
1,anakin sorry i forgot you dont like flying master
1,obiwan i dont mind flying but what youre doing is
1,suicide
1,they barely miss a commuter train
1,anakin master you know ive been flying since before i
1,could walk im very good at this
1,obiwan just slow down there there he goes
1,zam wessel and the jedi race through a line of cross
1,traffic made up of giant trucks the speeders bank sideways
1,as they slide around rightangle turns between buildings
1,zam races into a tram tunnel
1,obiwan wait dont go in there take it easy
1,anakin dont worry master
1,anakin zooms into the tunnel after zam they see a tram
1,coming at them they brake turn around and race out
1,barely ahead of the charging commuter transport
1,obiwan you know i dont like it when you do that
1,anakin sorry master dont worry this guys gonna kill
1,himself any minute now
1,zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic deliberately trying
1,to throw the jedi off oncoming speeders swerve trying to
1,avoid zam and the jedi zam does a quick tight loopover
1,and ends up behind the jedi she is now in a much better
1,position to fire at them with her laser pistol to avoid
1,being hit by the laser bolts anakin slams on the brakes
1,and moves alongside zam she now fires pointblank at obi
1,wan
1,obiwan what are you doing hes gonna blast me
1,anakin right  this isnt working
1,anakin slides underneath zams speeder they race along in
1,traffic one speeder right on top of the other the bounty
1,hunter skims over the rooftops causing anakin to drop
1,behind anakin goes through his gears zooming around
1,traffic they race at high speed across a wide flat
1,surface of the city planet a large spacecraft almost
1,collides with them as it attempts to land 
1,obiwan watch out for those banners
1,they round a corner and clip a flag which gets caught on
1,one of the front air scoops
1,obiwan that was too close
1,anakin clear that
1,obiwan what
1,anakin clear the flag were losing power hurry
1,obiwan leans out of the speeder then crawls out onto the
1,front engine and pulls the flag free of the scoop the
1,speeder lurches forward with a surge of power
1,obiwan whooooaaa dont do that i dont  like it when
1,you do that
1,anakin so sorry master
1,they chase the bounty hunter through a power refinery zam
1,shoots a power coupler causing voltage like lightning to
1,jump across a gap from one coupler to another anakin stays
1,on course piloting the speeder directly through the arc
1,anakin and obiwans bodies ripple with blue power
1,obiwan anakin how many times have i told you to stay
1,away from the power couplings slow down dont go through
1,there
1,huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the
1,speeders pass
1,obiwan yiiii what are you doing
1,anakin sorry master
1,obiwan sarcastically oh that was good
1,anakin that was crazy
1,zam slides around a corner sideways blocking an alley
1,firing pointblank as anakin approaches
1,anakin ahh damn
1,obiwan stop
1,anakin no we can make it
1,anakin barely misses the bounty hunters speeder as he
1,dives under it and through a small gap in the building
1,hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control
1,anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder narrowly
1,missing a crane barely clipping a pair of giant struts a
1,giant gas ball shoots up causing anakin to spin and bump a
1,building stalling the speeder
1,obiwan im crazy im crazy im crazy
1,anakin i got us through that one all right
1,obiwan angrily no you didnt weve stalled and you
1,almost got us killed
1,anakin i think were still alive
1,anakin works to get the speeder started it races to life
1,obiwan very angrily it was stupid
1,anakin sheepishly i could have made it
1,obiwan furious but you didnt and now weve lost him
1,for good
1,suddenly there is an ambush laser bolts are everywhere
1,explosions surround them they look up to see zam wessel
1,take off
1,anakin no we didnt
1,out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear
1,after zam they are smoking obiwan slaps out the small
1,fire on the dashboard zam goes up and down through cross
1,traffic there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits
1,them zam turns down and left between two buildings anakin
1,pulls up and to the right
1,obiwan where are you going he went down there the
1,other way
1,anakin master if we keep this chase going that creeps
1,gonna end up deepfried personally id very much like to
1,find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for
1,this is a shortcut i think
1,obiwan sarcastic what do you mean you think
1,anakin turns up a side street zooming up several small
1,passageways then stops hovering about fifty stories up
1,obiwan well you lost him
1,anakin im deeply sorry master
1,anakin looks around front and back he spots something he
1,seems to  start counting to himself as he watches something
1,below approach
1,obiwan well this is some kind of shortcut he went
1,completely the other way once again anakin
1,anakin excuse me for a moment
1,anakin jumps out of the speeder obiwan looks down and
1,sees zams speeder about five stories below them cruising
1,past 
1,obiwan i hate it when he does that
1,anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunters
1,speeder the speeder wobbles under the impact zam looks up
1,and realizes what has happened
1,zam takes off and anakin slides to the back strut and
1,almost slips off but manages to hang on anakin works his
1,way back to zam who caught off guard briefly changes
1,into her clawdite form zam stops suddenly and anakin
1,flies forward to the left front fork zam shoots at him
1,with a laser pistol there is a blast near anakins hand
1,which breaks off a piece of the speeder anakin slides to
1,the right fork of the speeder where zam cant reach him
1,he scrambles to the top holding onto an air scoop
1,obiwan has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder
1,and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder the two
1,speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through
1,cross traffic finally anakin is able to get hold of his
1,lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of
1,the speeder zam takes out her laser pistol and starts
1,firing at the helpless jedi knocking the sword out of his
1,hand obiwan races under the speeder and catches the jedi
1,weapon in the passengers seat
1,anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and using the
1,force pulls the gun out of zams hand she grabs the
1,jedis hand and they struggle for the weapon it goes off
1,blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder the speeder
1,careens wildly out of control zam struggles to pull the
1,speeder out of its nosedive obiwan gets slowed down by
1,traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunters speeder
1,just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground
1,zam pulls it out and it slides hard on the pavement in a
1,shower of sparks anakin goes flying into the street
1,exterior entertainment street  night
1,zam exits the crashed speeder and runs anakin picks
1,himself up off the pavement and runs after her down the
1,very crowded street
1,its the seedy underbelly of the city broken sidewalks
1,garish lights reflected in filthy puddles its pretty
1,crowded with various alien lowlifes panhandling droids
1,and the occasional group of upperclass slummers
1,anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the
1,fleeing zam he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd then
1,sees her again the young jedi is having a very difficult
1,time getting through the crowd ahead zam turns in through
1,a door and disappears a nightclub sign is flashing over
1,the door
1,obiwan lands the speeder in the nearby street he gets out
1,and runs through the crowd toward anakin anakin is just
1,about to follow zam into the nightclub when obiwan catches
1,up to him
1,obiwan anakin
1,anakin she went into that club master

1,anakin dont get me wrong obiwan is a great mentor as
1,wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu i am

1,too but he feels im too unpredictable other jedi my
1,age have gone through the trials and made it i know i
1,started my training late but he wont let me move on
1,padm  that must be frustrating

1,padm  because i can see what youre thinking
1,anakin laughing ahh so you have jedi powers too
1,dorm  is watching with concern

1,padm  youll be fine
1,dorm  its not me mlady i worry about you what if they
1,realize youve left the capital
1,padm  looks to anakin then my jedi protector will have
1,to prove how good he is
1,dorm  and padm  smile anakin frowns as obiwan pulls him
1,aside
1,obiwan anakin dont do anything without first consulting
1,either myself or the council
1,anakin yes master

1,us
1,they laugh
1,obiwan and captain typho watch anakin and padm  disappear
1,into the  vastness of the spaceport with artoo trundling

1,obiwan its a toxic dart i need to know where it came
1,from and who made it
1,sp one moment please
1,diagrams and data appear on the screen scrolling past at

1,tray slides out
1,sp markings cannot be identified as you can see on your
1,screen subject weapon does not exist in any known culture
1,probably selfmade by a warrior not associated with any
1,known society stand away from the sensor tray please
1,obiwan excuse me could you try again please
1,sp master jedi our records are very thorough they
1,cover eighty percent of the galaxy if i cant tell you

1,obiwan places the dart on the table between them dexs
1,eyes widen he puts down his mug
1,dexter jettster softly well whaddya know
1,dexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy
1,fingers and peers at it
1,dexter jettster i aint seen one of these since i was
1,prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim
1,obiwan can you tell me where it came from
1,dexter grins he puts the dart down between them
1,dexter jettster this baby belongs to them cloners what
1,you got here is a kamino saberdart
1,obiwan kamino saberdart i wonder why it didnt show
1,up in our analysis archive
1,dexter jettster its these funny little cuts on the side
1,give it away those analysis droids youve got over there
1,only focus on symbols you know i should think you jedi
1,would have more respect for the difference between
1,knowledge and wisdom
1,obiwan well dex if droids could think we wouldnt be
1,here would we laughing kamino doesnt sound
1,familiar is it part of the republic
1,dexter jettster no its beyond the outer rim id say
1,about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze toward the
1,south it should be easy to find even for those droids in
1,your archive these kaminoans keep to themselves theyre
1,cloners damned good ones too
1,obiwan picks up the dart holding it midway between them
1,obiwan cloners are they friendly
1,dexter jettster it depends
1,obiwan on what dex
1,dexter grins 
1,dexter jettster on how good your manners are and how
1,big your pocketbook is
1,exterior jedi temple  day
1,the main entrance at the base of the huge temple is
1,bustling with activity all sorts of jedi are coming and
1,going
1,interior jedi temple archive library  day
1,a bronze bust of count dooku stands among a line of other
1,busts of jedi in the archive room obiwan stands in front
1,of it studying the striking features of the chiseled face
1,on the walls lighted computer panels seem to stretch into
1,infinity farther along the room in the background five
1,jedi are seated at tables studying archive material
1,after obiwan studies the bust for a few moments before
1,madame jocasta nu the jedi archivist is standing next to
1,him she is an elderly fraillooking human jedi tough as
1,old boots and smart as a whip
1,jocasta nu did you call for assistance
1,obiwan distracted in thought yes yes i did
1,jocasta nu he has a powerful face doesnt he he was one
1,of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of
1,knowing
1,obiwan i never understood why he quit only twenty jedi
1,have ever left the order
1,jocasta nu sighs the lost twenty count dooku was the
1,most recent and the most painful no one likes to talk
1,about it his leaving was a great loss to the order
1,obiwan what happened
1,jocasta nu well count dooku was always a bit out of step
1,with the decisions of the council much like your old
1,master quigon jinn
1,obiwan surprised really
1,jocasta nu oh yes they were alike in many ways very
1,individual thinkers idealists
1,jocasta nu gazes at the bust
1,jocasta nu he was always striving to become a more
1,powerful jedi he wanted to be the best with a lightsaber
1,in the old style of fencing he had no match his knowledge
1,of the force was unique in the end i think he left
1,because he lost faith in the republic he believed that
1,politics were corrupt and he felt the jedi betrayed
1,themselves by serving the politicians he always had very
1,high expectations of government he disappeared for nine or
1,ten years then just showed up recently as the head of the
1,separatist movement
1,obiwan its very interesting im not sure i completely
1,understand
1,jocasta nu well im sure you didnt call me over here for
1,a history lesson are you having a problem master kenobi
1,obiwan yes im trying to find a planet system called
1,kamino it doesnt seem to show up on any of the archive
1,charts
1,jocasta nu kamino its not a system im familiar with
1,let me see
1,jocasta nu leans over obiwans shoulder looking at the
1,screen
1,jocasta nu are you sure you have the right coordinates
1,obiwan nodding according to my information it should
1,be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the rishi
1,maze
1,jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns
1,jocasta nu no coordinates it sounds like the sort of
1,directions youd get from a street tout some old miner
1,or furbog trader
1,obiwan all three actually
1,jocasta nu are you sure it exists
1,obiwan absolutely
1,jocasta nu let me do a gravitational scan
1,obiwan and jocasta nu study the star map hologram
1,jocasta nu there are some inconsistencies here maybe the
1,planet youre seeking was destroyed
1,obiwan wouldnt that be on record
1,jocasta nu it ought to be unless it was very recent
1,shakes her head i hate to say it but it looks like the
1,system youre searching for doesnt exist
1,obiwan thats impossible perhaps the archives are
1,incomplete
1,jocasta nu the archives are comprehensive and totally
1,secure my young jedi one thing you may be absolutely sure
1,of  if an item does not appear in our records it does not
1,exist
1,obiwan stares at her then looks back to the map jocasta
1,nu notices a young boy approach she turns from obiwan and
1,leaves with the youngster
1,exterior space starship freighter
1,the massive slowmoving freighter moves through space
1,interior starfreighter steerage hold  day
1,the great gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their
1,belongings to one side artoo is coming to the head of a
1,food line holding two bowls with one of his little claw
1,arms he grabs a chunk of something that looks like bread
1,artoo slips a tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large
1,quantity a server sees him
1,server hey no droids
1,artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food
1,line the server shouts after him angrily the little droid
1,moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes
1,to anakin and padm s table where anakin is sound asleep
1,the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare he is very
1,restless
1,anakin no no mom no
1,he is sweating padm  leans over resting her hand on his
1,arm he wakes up with a start then realizes where he is
1,padm  simply looks at him he stares back somewhat
1,confused
1,anakin what
1,padm  you seemed to be having a nightmare
1,anakin looks at padm  a little more closely trying to see
1,if he has revealed any of his secrets she hands him a bowl
1,of mush and bread
1,padm  are you hungry
1,anakin yeah
1,padm  takes the food from artoo and sets it on a makeshift
1,table anakin rises and takes a seat as she places a bowl
1,in front of him
1,anakin thanks
1,padm  we went to lightspeed a while ago
1,anakin looks into padm s eyes
1,anakin i look forward to seeing naboo again ive thought
1,about it every day since i left its by far the most
1,beautiful place ive ever seen
1,padm  is a little unnerved by his intense stare 
1,padm  it may not be as you remember it time changes
1,perception
1,anakin sometimes it does sometimes for the better
1,padm  it must be difficult having sworn your life to the
1,jedi not being able to visit the places you like or
1,do the things you like
1,anakin or be with the people i love
1,padm  are you allowed to love i thought it was forbidden
1,for a jedi
1,anakin attachment is forbidden possession is forbidden
1,compassion which i would define as unconditional love is
1,central to a jedis life so you might say were encouraged
1,to love
1,padm  you have changed so much
1,anakin you havent changed a bit youre exactly the way i
1,remember you in my dreams i doubt if naboo has changed
1,much either
1,padm  it hasnt
1,there is an awkward moment
1,padm  continuing changing the subject you were dreaming
1,about your mother earlier werent you
1,anakin yes i left tatooine so long ago my memory of
1,her is fading i dont want to lose it recently ive been
1,seeing her in my dreams vivid dreams scary dreams i
1,worry about her
1,padm  gives anakin a sympathetic look
1,interior jedi temple main hallway  day
1,obiwan walks through the main hallway to the training
1,area
1,interior jedi temple training veranda  day
1,obiwan comes out onto the veranda and stops watching
1,twenty or so fouryearolds doing training exercises
1,supervised by yoda they wear helmets over their eyes and
1,try to strike little training droids with their miniature
1,lightsabers the droids dance in front of them
1,yoda dont think feel be as one with the force help
1,you it will he sees obiwan younglings  enough a
1,visitor we have welcome him
1,the children turn off their lightsabers
1,yoda master obiwan kenobi meet the mighty bear clan
1,children welcome master obiwan
1,obiwan i am sorry to disturb you master
1,yoda what help to you can i be
1,obiwan im looking for a planet described to me by an old
1,friend i trust him but the system doesnt show up on the
1,archive maps
1,yoda lost a planet master obiwan has how
1,embarrassing how embarrassing liam the shades an
1,interesting puzzle gather younglings around the map
1,reader clear your minds and find obiwans wayward planet
1,we will
1,the reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the
1,top the children gather around it obiwan takes out a
1,little glass ball and places it into the bowl the window
1,shades close the reader lights up and projects the star
1,map hologram into the room the children laugh some of
1,them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars obi
1,wan walks into the display
1,obiwan this is where it ought to be but it isnt
1,gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to
1,this spot there should be a star here but there isnt
1,yoda most interesting gravitys silhouette remains but
1,the star and all its planets have disappeared how can this
1,be now younglings in your mind what is the first thing
1,you see an answer a thought anyone
1,there is a brief pause then a child puts his hand up yoda
1,nods
1,jedi child jack master because someone erased it from the
1,archive memory
1,children thats right yes thats what happened someone
1,erased it
1,jedi child may if the planet blew up the gravity would go
1,away
1,obiwan stares yoda chuckles
1,yoda truly wonderful the mind of a child is the padawan
1,is right go to the center of the gravitys pull and find
1,your planet you will
1,yoda and obiwan move away from the children with a hand
1,movement obiwan causes the star map to disappear obiwan
1,uses the force to call the glass ball back to his hand as
1,the two walk into an adjoining room
1,obiwan but master yoda who could have erased information
1,from the archives thats impossible isnt it
1,yoda frowning dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is
1,only a jedi could have erased those files but who and why
1,harder to answer meditate on this i will may the force
1,be with you
1,exterior naboo spaceport  day
1,the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed
1,padm  anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming
1,from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area they
1,exit onto the main plaza
1,exterior naboo palace grand courtyard  afternoon
1,the speeder bus pulls up and stops padm  anakin and
1,artoo get out the great courtyard stretches before them
1,and they see the rosecolored domes of the palace on the 
1,far side artoo whistles they pick up their gear and start
1,to cross the courtyard artoo trundles behind them
1,anakin if i grew up here i dont think id ever leave
1,padm  laughing i doubt that
1,anakin no really when i started my training i was very
1,homesick and very lonely this city and my mom were the
1,only pleasant things i had to think about the problem
1,was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt but
1,i would feel better if i thought about the palace  the way
1,it shimmers in the sunlight  the way the air always smells
1,of flowers
1,padm  and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls the
1,first time i saw the capital i was very young id never
1,seen a waterfall before i thought they were so
1,beautiful i never dreamed one day id live in the
1,palace
1,anakin well tell me did you dream of power and politics
1,when you were a little girl
1,padm  laughing no that was the last thing i thought of
1,but the more history i studied the more i realized how
1,much good politicians could do after school i became a
1,senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew
1,it i was elected queen for the most part it was because
1,of my conviction that reform was possible i wasnt the
1,youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on
1,it im not sure i was old enough im not sure i was
1,ready
1,anakin the people you served thought you did a good job i
1,heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could
1,stay in office
1,padm  popular rule is not democracy annie it gives the
1,people what they want not what they need and truthfully
1,i was relieved when my two terms were up so were my
1,parents they worried about me during the blockade and
1,couldnt wait for it all to be over actually i was hoping
1,to have a family by now my sisters have the most
1,amazing wonderful kids so when the queen asked me to
1,serve as senator i couldnt refuse her
1,anakin i agree i think the republic needs you im glad
1,you chose to serve i feel things are going to happen in
1,our generation that will change the galaxy in profound
1,ways
1,padm  i think so too
1,anakin and padm  walk toward the palace artoo continues to
1,follow
1,interior naboo palace throne room  afternoon
1,queen jamillia is seated on the throne flanked by sio
1,bibble and a couple of advisors four handmaidens stand
1,close by and guards are at the doors
1,queen jamillia weve been worried about you takes her
1,hand im so glad youre safe padm 
1,padm  thank you your highness i only wish i could have
1,served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
1,sio bibble given the circumstances senator you know it
1,was the only decision her highness could have made
1,queen jamillia how many systems have joined count dooku
1,and the separatists
1,padm  thousands and more are leaving the republic every
1,day if the senate votes to create an army im sure its
1,going to push us into a civil war
1,sio bibble its unthinkable there hasnt been a full
1,scale war since the formation of the republic
1,queen jamillia do you see any way through negotiations
1,to bring the separatists back into the republic
1,padm  not if they feel threatened the separatists dont
1,have an army but if they are provoked they will move to
1,defend themselves im sure of that and with no time or
1,money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the
1,commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
1,queen jamillia the armies of commerce why has nothing
1,been done in the senate to restrain them
1,padm  im afraid that despite the chancellors best
1,efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even
1,senators on the payrolls of the guilds
1,sio bibble its outrageous that after all of those
1,hearings and four trials in the supreme court nute gunray
1,is still the viceroy of the trade federation i fear the
1,senate is powerless to resolve this crisis do those money
1,mongers control everything
1,queen jamillia remember counselor the courts were able
1,to reduce the federations armies thats a move in the
1,right direction
1,padm  there are rumors your highness that the trade
1,federation army was not reduced as they were ordered
1,queen jamillia we must keep our faith in the republic the
1,day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose
1,it
1,padm  lets pray that day never comes
1,queen jamillia in the meantime we must consider your own
1,safety
1,sio bibble signals all the other advisors and attendants
1,bow and leave the room
1,sio bibble to anakin what is your suggestion master
1,jedi
1,padm  anakins not a jedi yet counselor hes still a
1,padawan learner i was thinking
1,anakin nettled hey hold on a minute
1,padm  excuse me i was thinking i would stay in the lake
1,country there are some places up there that are very
1,isolated
1,anakin excuse me i am in charge of security here
1,mlady
1,sio bibble and queen jamillia exchange a look something is
1,going on here
1,padm  annie my life is at risk and this is my home i
1,know it very well that is why were here i think it
1,would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in
1,this instance
1,anakin takes a deep breath sorry mlady
1,queen jamillia perfect its settled then
1,anakin glares at padm  then queen jamillia gets up and
1,they all start to leave
1,queen jamillia padm  i had an audience with your father
1,yesterday i told him what was happening he hopes you will
1,visit your mother before you leave your familys very
1,worried about you
1,padm  thank you your highness
1,padm  looks worried they all exit down the main staircase
1,exterior theed residential area side street  afternoon
1,people are passing through the little street old men are
1,sunning themselves women are gossiping kids are playing
1,anakin padm  and artoo turn onto a side street anakin is

1,padm  when i was in level three we used to come here for
1,school retreat see that island we used to swim there
1,every day i love the water
1,anakin i do too i guess it comes from growing up on a
1,desert planet
1,padm  becomes aware that anakin is looking at her
1,padm  we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry
1,us and try to guess the names of the birds singing
1,anakin i dont like sand its coarse and rough and
1,irritating and it gets everywhere not like here here
1,everythings soft and smooth
1,he touches her arm padm  has become receptive to the way
1,he looks at her but is nervous
1,padm  there was a very old man who lived on the island he
1,used to make glass out of sand  and vases and necklaces
1,out of the glass they were magical
1,anakin looks into her eyes everything here is magical
1,padm  you could look into the glass and see the water the
1,way it ripples and moves it looked so real but it
1,wasnt
1,anakin sometimes when you believe something to be real
1,it becomes real
1,they look into each others eyes
1,padm  i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass
1,you would lose yourself
1,anakin i think its true
1,anakin kisses padm  she doesnt resist she comes to her
1,senses and pulls away
1,padm  no i shouldnt have done that
1,anakin im sorry when im around you my mind is no
1,longer my own

1,interior tipoca city clone center classroom  day
1,the tour continues through a classroom filled with
1,identical young boy clones
1,lama su we take great pride in our combat education and
1,training programs this group was created about five years
1,ago
1,obiwan you mentioned growth acceleration
1,lama su oh yes its essential otherwise a mature clone
1,would take a lifetime to grow now we can do it in half
1,the time those items you saw on the parade ground were
1,started ten years ago when sifodyas first placed the
1,order and theyre already mature
1,interior tipoca city clone center commissary  day
1,lama su conducts obiwan through a large eating area taun
1,we follows as they walk by hundreds of clones who look
1,exactly alike all about twenty years old dressed in
1,black they are seated at tables eating
1,lama su youll find they are totally obedient taking any
1,order without question we modified their genetic structure
1,to make them less independent than the original host 
1,obiwan who was the original host
1,lama su a bounty hunter called jango fett we felt a jedi
1,would be the perfect choice but sifodyas handpicked
1,jango fett himself
1,obiwan where is this bounty hunter now
1,lama su oh we keep him here
1,interior tipoca city clone center barracks  day
1,the tour continues through a long corridor filled with
1,narrow transparent tubes into which clones are climbing
1,once in the tube the clone goes to sleep
1,lama su apart from his pay which is considerable fett
1,demanded only one thing  an unaltered clone for himself
1,curious isnt it
1,obiwan unaltered
1,lama su pure genetic replication no tampering with the
1,structure to make it more docile and no growth
1,acceleration
1,obiwan i would very much like to meet this jango fett

1,padm  are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on
1,me
1,anakin they only work on the weakminded you are anything
1,but weakminded
1,padm  all right i was twelve his name was palo we
1,were both in the legislative youth program he was a few
1,years older then i very cute dark curly hair

1,to him
1,padm  i went into public service he went on to become an
1,artist
1,anakin maybe he was the smart one
1,padm  you really dont like politicians do you
1,anakin i like two or three but im not really sure about
1,one of them smiling i dont think the system works
1,padm  how would you have it work
1,anakin we need a system where the politicians sit down and
1,discuss the problem agree whats in the best interests of
1,all the people and then do it
1,padm  that is exactly what we do the trouble is that
1,people dont always agree in fact they hardly ever do
1,anakin then they should be made to
1,padm  by whom whos going to make them
1,anakin i dont know someone
1,padm  you
1,anakin of course not me
1,padm  but someone
1,anakin someone wise
1,padm  that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me
1,a mischievous little grin creeps across his face
1,anakin well if it works
1,padm  stares at anakin he looks back at her straight
1,faced but cant hold back a smile
1,padm  youre making fun of me

1,catches it padm  throws two more pieces of fruit and
1,anakin catches them

1,anakin then starts to juggle the fruit padm  laughs and
1,throws more fruit at him he manages to juggle them too
1,until there are too many and he loses control and ducks
1,letting food fall on his head they both laugh

1,his arms padm  starts laughing as anakin runs in circles
1,chased by the shaak
1,exterior naboo mountain meadow  late afteroon
1,the shaak crosses in front of padm  with anakin riding it
1,facing the shaaks tail anakin attempts to stand on the
1,galloping shaaks back but the shaak bucks and anakin
1,loses his balance and falls off padm  laughs even harder
1,anakin lies still concerned padm  jumps up and runs to
1,where anakin is face down in the grass 
1,padm  annie annie are you all right
1,she turns him over he is pulling a stupid face at her and
1,laughing she yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him
1,he catches her arm she struggles they roll over in the
1,grass embracing and looking into each others eyes
1,suddenly they become aware of the contact between them
1,they let go of each other quickly and sit up looking away
1,anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her she takes
1,it he pulls her up and now they are easy together not
1,selfconscious any more padm  scrambles up onto the shaak
1,behind anakin she puts her arms around his waist and leans
1,against his back anakin digs his heels in the shaak
1,starts forward and they ride away

1,desperately for a handhold on the slick surface obiwan
1,reaches out for his lightsaber using the force to bring it
1,to him but jango fires a thin wire from his wristpack it
1,wraps around obiwans wrists before he can retrieve the
1,lightsaber
1,jango rockets into the air dragging obiwan behind him
1,along the platform surface as obiwan slides toward some
1,columns he manages to maneuver himself into a roll avoiding
1,a collision by leveraging the wire against the structure
1,and pulling himself to his feet obiwan pulls with all his
1,weight against the momentum of the wire causing jango to
1,drop and crash into the ground jangos rocketpack breaks
1,free from his back and explodes

1,the surface obiwan slides past him as jango finally
1,ejects the wire free from his wrist obiwan cannot stop
1,the speed of his slide and shoots off the edge falling 
1,obiwan uses the force and causes the wire to wrap around a
1,pole stopping his descent he swings and drops onto a
1,small service platform just above the waves he hauls
1,himself to his feet when jango looks down the jedi has
1,disappeared jango uses his forearm claws to climb back to
1,the landing platform and runs toward his ship

1,punches buttons the engines roar
1,obiwan comes running out onto the landing platform and

1,padm  and if i dont join your rebellion i assume this
1,jedi with me will also die
1,count dooku i dont wish to make you to join our cause

1,the trade federation the commerce guilds and the others
1,count what is happening here is not government that has
1,been bought out by business its business becoming

1,without your cooperation i can do nothing to stop their
1,execution
1,padm  and what about me am i to be executed also
1,dooku i wouldnt think of such an offense but there are
1,individuals who have a strong interest in your demise
1,mlady it has nothing to do with politics im afraid
1,its purely personal and they have already paid great sums
1,to have you assassinated im sure they will push hard to
1,have you included in the executions im sorry but if you
1,are not going to cooperate i must turn you over to the

1,obiwan continuing im hit anakin
1,anakin i see them    buzz droids

1,anakin maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors slam shut
1,obiwan ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit he jumps dear just as his ship explodes battle droids rush at him from all directions
1,anakin jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the battle droids to where obiwan is fighting artoo pops out of the ship and follows anakin

1,anakin and obiwan use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor
1, int generator roomtrade federation cruiser
1,the two jedi cut their way down several floors into a large generator room huge explosions outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break and fluid is spewing everywhere the jedi get up and turn off their light sabers anakin dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it
1,obiwan    fuel the slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion thats why theyve stopped shooting
1,anakin well then were safe for the time being
1,obiwan your idea of safe is not the same as mine
1,they run explosions rattle the ship and pipes continue to burst around them spilling more fuel into the hallway at the far end six super battle droids drop into the fuel the sounds of shield doors closing and locking echo throughout the hallway they pass several large power generators which are topped with sparking excess power dischargers
1,anakin theyre sealing this section off
1,obiwan six droids coming our way
1,the last of the doors can be heard closing in the distance
1,anakin keep moving there must be vents    this way

1,obiwan well never get through that its too small
1,they move toward a second vent obiwan is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling anakin feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent he closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening then he moves on obiwan is forced into handtohand combat with one of the super battle droids it pulls the jedi under the fuel just before he is about to drown obiwan disables the super battle droid by pushing him into an exhaust pipe
1,the fuel is up to the jedis chins anakin finds a very very small metal grate then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose
1,anakin i found our escape vent
1,obiwan anakin this is no time for jokes were in serious trouble here
1,anakin only in your mind my master look no structure

1, int vent shafttrade federation cruiser
1,the two jedi pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube
1,anakin heres a way out

1,obiwan pulls himself together and attacks again cutting off the droid bodyguards head the droid bodyguard keeps attacking anakin struggles to defend himself against the other manic droid bodyguard he cuts the droid bodyguard in half two battle droids try to take the chancellor away
1,anakin follows them down the hallway and cuts them down rescuing the chancellor
1,obiwan finishes off the headless bodyguard it crumbles to the floor in pieces

1,pilot the ship is breaking up
1,general grievous weve run out of time
1,obiwan tries to get at general grievous anakin runs at the general from the opposing side general grievous turns and throws his electrified staff at the window it breaks causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space general grievous is the first one sucked out into space he fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship he swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship

1,obiwan continues to fight the battle droids the droids have backed him into a corner obiwan hides behind a control panel as the droids blast away at him he jumps up and over the droids cutting most of them down before he lands he destroys the droids and joins anakin
1,anakin and obiwan cut through the rest of the droids as if they were made of butter palpatine stands in shock as he watches the carnage droid parts are firing everywhere obiwan and anakin stand back to back and cut down the last of the droids just as there is a huge shudder followed by more alarms sparks begin to fly outside the windows

1,anakin yes
1,yoda careful you must be when sensing the future anakin the fear of loss is a path to the dark side
1,anakin i wont let these visions come true master yoda
1,yoda death is a natural part of life rejoice for those around you who transform into the force mourn them do not miss them do not attachment leads to jealousy the shadow of greed that is

1,obiwan you missed the report on the outer rim sieges
1,anakin im sorry i was held up i have no excuse
1,obiwan in short they are going very well saleucami has fallen and master vos has moved his troops to boz pity
1,anakin whats wrong then
1,obiwan the senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today
1,anakin well that can only mean less deliberating and more action is that bad it will make it easier for us to end this war
1,obiwan anakin be careful of your friend palpatine
1,anakin be careful of what
1,obiwan he has requested your presence
1,anakin what for
1,obiwan he would not say
1,anakin he didnt inform the jedi council thats unusual isnt it
1,obiwan all of this is unusual and its making me feel uneasy youre probably aware that relations between the council and the chancellor are stressed
1,anakin i know the council has grown wary of the chancellors power mine also for that matter arent we all working together to save the republic why all this distrust
1,obiwan the force grows dark anakin and we are all affected by it be wary of your feelings

1,palpatine anakin this afternoon the senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the jedi council
1,anakin the jedi will no longer report to the senate
1,palpatine they will report to me    personally the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war this will bring a quick end to things
1,anakin i agree but the jedi council may not see it that way
1,palpatine there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security
1,anakin with all due respect sir the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments
1,palpatine thank you my friend but in this case i have no choice    this war must be won
1,anakin everyone will agree on that
1,palpatine anakin ive known you since you were a small boy i have advised you over the years when i could  i am very proud of your accomplishments you have won many battles the jedi council thought were lost    and you saved my life i hope you trust me anakin
1,anakin of course
1,palpatine i need your help son
1,anakin what do you mean
1,palpatine i fear the jedi the council keeps pushing for more control theyre shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy    ideals i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy
1,anakin i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic sir
1,palpatine nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words im depending on you
1,anakin for what i dont understand
1,palpatine to be the eyes ears and voice of the republic   
1,anakin thinks about this
1,palpatine continuing anakin    im appointing you to be my personal representative on the jedi council
1,anakin me a master i am overwhelmed sir but the council elects its own members they will never accept this
1,palpatine i think they will    they need you more than you know

1,bail organa now that he has control of the jedi council the chancellor has appointed governors to oversee all star systems in the republic
1,fang zar when did this happen
1,bail organa the decree was posted this morning
1,padme do you think he will dismantle the senate
1,mon mothma why bother as a practical matter the senate no longer exists
1,giddean danu the constitution is in shreds amendment after amendment    executive directives sometimes a dozen in one day
1,bail organa we cant let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight
1,everyone looks at each other a little worried at the implications of what was just said
1,terr taneel what are you suggesting
1,bail organa i apologize i didnt mean to sound like a separatist
1,mon mothma we are not separatists trying to leave the republic we are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the republic
1,bail organa it has become increasingly clear to many of us that the chancellor has become an enemy of democracy
1,padme i cant believe it has come to this chancellor palpatine is one of my oldest advisors he served as my ambassador when i was queen
1,glddean danu senator i fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the senate
1,mon mothma the chancellor has played the senators well they know where the power lies and they will do whatever it takes to share in it palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it
1,bail organa we cant sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it senator mon mothma and i are putting together an organization   
1,padme say no more senator organa i understand at this point its better to leave some things unsaid
1,bail organa yes i agree and we must not discuss this with anyone without everyone in this group agreeing
1,mon mothma that means those closest to you    even family  no one can be told
1,they all nod their heads padme considers this for a moment

1,anakin i will do my best to uphold the principles of the jedi order
1,yoda allow this appointment lightly the council does not disturbing is this move by chancellor palpatine
1,anakin i understand
1,mace you are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of master
1,anakin reacts with anger
1,anakin what  how can you do this this is outrageous its unfair    im more powerful than any of you how can you be on the council and not be a master
1,mace take a seat young skywalker
1,anakin forgive me master
1,anakin goes and sits in one of the empty chairs everyone is embarrassed kiadimundi who appears as a hologram speaks
1,kladimundi we have surveyed all systems in the republic and have found no sign of general grievous
1,yoda hiding in the outer rim grievous is the outlying systems you must sweep
1,obiwan it may take some time    we do not have many ships to spare
1,mace we cannot take ships from the front line
1,obiwan and yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup
1,yoda master kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait
1,kladimundi what about the droid attack on the wookiees
1,mace it is critical we send an attack group there immediately
1,obiwan hes right that is a system we cannot afford to lose its the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant
1,anakin i know that system well it would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet
1,mace skywalker your assignment is here with the chancellor and kenobi must find general grievous
1,yoda go i will good relations with the wookiees i have
1,mace it is settled then yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the wookiees on kashyyyk may the force be with us all

1, int coruscantjedi templemassive main hallway and alcovelate afternoon
1,anakin and obiwan walk through one of the massive jedi temple hallways anakin is furious
1,anakin what kind of nonsense is this put me on the council and not make me a master thats never been done in the history of the jedi its insulting
1,obiwan calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age    its never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is youre too close to the chancellor the council doesnt like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
1,anakin i swear to you i didnt ask to be put on the council   
1,obiwan but its what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
1,anakin that has nothing to do with this
1,obiwan anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation
1,anakin you mean divided loyalties
1,obiwan i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor i was very clear why didnt you listen you walked right into it
1,anakin the council is upset im the youngest to ever serve
1,obiwan no it is not anakin i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride those are not jedi thoughts theyre dangerous dark thoughts
1,anakin master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities i know where my loyalties lie
1,obiwan i hope so   
1,anakin i sense theres more to this talk than youre saying
1,obiwan anakin the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you
1,anakin and
1,obiwan anakin look i am on your side i didnt want to see you put in this situation
1,anakin what situation
1,obiwan takes a deep breath the council wants you to report on all of the chancellors dealings they want to know what hes up to
1,anakin they want me to spy on the chancellor thats treason
1,obiwan we are at war anakin the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic even if the chancellor does not
1,anakin why didnt the council give me this assignment when we were in session
1,obiwan this assignment is not to be on record the council asked me to approach you on this personally
1,anakin the chancellor is not a bad man obiwan he befriended me hes watched out for me ever since i arrived here
1,obiwan that is why you must help us anakin our allegiance is to the senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired
1,anakin master the senate demanded that he stay longer
1,obiwan yes but use your feelings anakin something is out of place
1,anakin youre asking me to do something against the jedi code against the republic against a mentor    and a friend thats whats out of place here why are you asking this of me

1,yoda too much under the sway of the chancellor he is much anger there is in him too much pride in his powers
1,mace its very dangerous putting them together i dont think the boy can handle it i dont trust him
1,obiwan hell be all right i trust him with my life
1,macei wish i did
1,obiwan with all due respect master is he not the chosen one is he not to destroy the sith and bring balance to the force
1,mace so the prophecy says
1,yoda a prophecy    that misread could have been
1,obiwan he will not let me down he never has

1,padme laughs my motherly intuition
1,she puts his hand on her belly
1,anakin whoa with a kick that strong its got to be a girl
1,they laugh
1,padme i heard about your appointment anakin im so proud of you
1,anakin i may be on the council but    they refused to accept me as a jedi master
1,padme patience in time they will recognize your skills
1,anakin they still treat me as if i were a padawan learner   they fear my power thats the problem
1,padme anakin   
1,anakin sometimes i wonder whats happening to the jedi order    i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
1,padme have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side
1,anakin suspicious what do you mean
1,padme what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy
1,anakin i dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist
1,padme anakin this war represents a failure to listen    now youre closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
1,anakin growing angry dont ask me to do that padme make a motion in the senate where that kind of a request belongs im not your errand boy im not anyones errand boy
1,padme what is it
1,anakin nothing
1,padme dont do this    dont shut me out let me help you
1,anakin you cant help me    im trying to help you

1,padme is startled at this
1,padme i sense there are things you are not telling me

1,anakin you wanted to see me chancellor
1,palpatine yes anakin come closer i have good news our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous he is hiding in the utapau system
1,anakin at last well be able to capture that monster and end this war
1,palpatine i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didnt select you for this assignment you are the best choice by far   but they cant always be trusted to do the right thing
1,anakin they try
1,palpatine sit down to his aides leave us
1,anakin sits next to palpatine the chancellor leans over to him
1,palpatine continuing anakin you know im not able to rely on the jedi council if they havent included you in their plot they soon will
1,anakin im not sure i understand
1,palpatine you must sense what i have come to suspect    the jedi council want control of the republic    theyre planning to betray me
1,anakin i dont think   
1,palpatine anakin search your feelings you know dont you
1,anakin i know they dont trust you   
1,palpatine or the senate    or the republic    or democracy for that matter
1,anakin i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken
1,palpatine why they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didnt they
1,anakin doesnt say anything he simply looks down
1,palpatine continuing they asked you to spy on me didnt they
1,anakin i dont know  i dont know what to say
1,palpatine remember back to your early teachings anakin all those who gain power are afraid to lose it even the jedi
1,anakin the jedi use their power for good
1,palpatine good is a point of view anakin and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the jedi to be  
1,anakin    evil
1,palpatine    from a jedis point of view the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force that is why they are more powerful
1,anakin the sith rely on their passion for their strength they think inward only about themselves
1,palpatine and the jedi dont
1,anakin the jedi are selfless    they only care about others
1,palpatine smiles
1,palpatine or so youve been trained to believe why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong
1,anakin im not sure its wrong
1,palpatine have they asked you to betray the jedi code the constitution a friendship your own values think consider their motives keep your mind clear of assumptions the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith
1,anakin is deep in thought
1,palpatine continuing did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
1,anakin no
1,palpatine i thought not its not a story the jedi would tell you its a sith legend darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying
1,anakin he could actually save people from death
1,palpatine the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
1,anakin what happened to him
1,palpatine he became so powerful    the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep smiles plagueis never saw it coming its ironic he could save others from death but not himself

1,kladimundi yes this decision is ours to make
1,anakin is embarrassed and becomes sullen
1,yoda a master is needed with more experience
1,mace given our resources i recommend we send only one jedi    master kenobi

1,obiwan throws anakin a dirty look
1,anakin continuing no offense my master but im only stating a fact
1,obiwan oh no youre quite right but i do have the most experience with his ways of combat

1,palpatine i want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do my lady and when it does i guarantee an immediate return to democracy

1,kladimundi if he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of grievous then he should be removed from

1,anakin i wont be a pawn in your political game the jedi are my family

1, threepio at last  where have you been
1, threepio theyre heading in this direction what are we going to do  well be sent to the spice mines of kessel or smashed into who knows what
1, threepio wait a minute where are you going
1, imperial officer the death star plans are not in the main computer
1, vader where are those transmissions you intercepted
1, rebel officer we intercepted no transmissions aaah  this is a consular ship were on a diplomatic mission
1, vader if this is a consular ship where is the ambassador
1, vader commander tear this ship apart until youve found those plans and bring me the ambassador  i want her alive
1, trooper there she is set for stun
1, trooper shell be all right inform lord vader we have a prisoner
1, threepio hey youre not permitted in there  its restricted youll be deactivated for sure
1, threepio dont call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease  now come out before somebody sees you
1, threepio secret mission  what plans  what are you talking about  im not getting in there
1, threepio im going to regret this
1, chief pilot there goes another one
1, captain hold your fire  there are no life forms  it must have been shortcircuited
1, threepio thats funny the damage doesnt look as bad from out here
1, threepio are you sure this things safe
1, woman ive told you kids to slow down
1, fixer did i hear a young noise blast through here
1, camie it was just wormie on another rampage
1, luke shape it up you guys  biggs
1, luke i didnt know you were back  when did you get in
1, biggs just now  i wanted to surprise you hot shot  i thought youd be here certainly didnt expect you to be out working 
1, luke the academy didnt change you much but youre back so soon  hey what happened didnt you get your commission
1, biggs of course i got it  signed aboard the rand ecliptic last week  first mate biggs darklighter at your service i just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons
1, luke i almost forgot  theres a battle going on  right here in our system  come and look
1, deak not again  forget it
1, luke there they are
1, biggs thats no battle hot shot theyre just sitting there  probably a freightertanker refueling
1, luke but there was a lot of firing earlier
1, luke hey easy with those
1, camie dont worry about it wormie
1, fixer i keep telling you the rebellion is a long way from here  i doubt if the empire would even fight to keep this system  believe me luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing
1, leia lord vader i should have known  only you could be so bold  the imperial senate will not sit stillfor this when they hear youve attacked a diplomatic
1, vader dont play games with me your highness  you werent on any mercy mission this time  you passed directly through a restricted system  several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies  i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you
1, leia i dont know what youre talking about  im a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan
1, vader youre a part of the rebel alliance and a traitor  take her away
1, commander holding her is dangerous  if word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate
1, vader i have traced the rebel spies to her  now she is my only link to find their secret base
1, commander you anything
1, vader leave that to me  send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed
1, second officer lord vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship  and no transmissions were made  an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard
1, vader she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod  send a detachment down to retrieve them  see to it personally commander  therell be no one to stop us this time
1, commander yes sir
1, threepio how did i get into this mess  i really dont know how  we seem to be made to suffer  its our lot in life
1, threepio ive got to rest before i fall apart  my joints are almost frozen 
1, threepio what a desolate place this is
1, threepio where are you going
1, threepio well im not going that way  its much too rocky  this way is much easier
1, threepio what makes you think there are settlements over there
1, threepio dont get technical with me
1, threepio what mission  what are you talking about  ive had just about enough of you  go that way  youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile
1, threepio and dont let me catch you following me begging for help because you wont get it
1, threepio no more adventures  im not going that way
1, threepio that malfunctioning little twerp  this is all his fault  he tricked me into going this way but hell do no better
1, threepio wait whats that  a transport  im saved
1, threepio over here  help  please help
1, luke  so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on deaks trail  i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad  uncle owen was pretty upset  he grounded me for the rest of the season  you should have been there it was fantastic
1, biggs you ought to take it a little easy luke  you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley but those little skyhoppers are dangerous  keep it up and one day whammo youre going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall
1, luke look whos talking  now that youve been around those giant starships youre beginning to sound like my uncle youve gotten soft in the city
1, biggs ive missed you kid
1, luke well things havent been the same since you left biggs  its been soquiet
1, biggs luke i didnt come back just to say goodbye  i shouldnt tell you this but youre the only one i can trust and if i dont come back i want somebody to know
1, luke what are you talking about
1, biggs i made some friends at the academy  when our frigate goes to one of the central systems were going to jump ship and join the alliance
1, luke join the rebellion  are you kidding  how
1, biggs quiet down will ya  you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater
1, luke im sorry  im quiet listen how quiet i am  you can barely hear me
1, biggs my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact
1, luke around forever trying to find them
1, biggs i know its a long shot but if i dont find them ill do what i can on my own  its what we always talked about  luke im not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service  the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side  the side i believe in 
1, luke and im stuck here
1, biggs i thought you were going to the academy next term  youll get your chance to get off this rock
1, luke not likely  i had to cancel my application  there has been a lot of unrest among the sand people since you left theyve even raided the outskirts of anchorhead
1, biggs your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sand people with one blaster
1, luke i know but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off  he needs me for just one more season  i cant leave him now
1, biggs i feel for you luke youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important  what good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the empire  you know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systemsit wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the empire
1, luke it couldnt happen here  you said it yourself  the empire wont bother with this rock
1, biggs things always change
1, luke i wish i was going  are you going to be around long 
1, biggs no im leaving in the morning
1, luke then i guess i wont see you
1, biggs maybe someday  ill keep a lookout
1, luke well ill be at the academy next season after that who knows  i wont be drafted into the imperial starfleet thats for sure  take care of yourself youll always be the best friend ive got
1, biggs so long luke
1, threepio artoodetoo  its you  its you
1, first trooper someone was in the pod  the tracks go off in this direction 
1, second trooper look sir  droids
1, threepio wake up  wake up
1, threepio were doomed
1, threepio do you think theyll melt us down
1, threepio dont shoot  dont shoot  will this never end
1, beru luke tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce
1, luke it looks like we dont have much of a choice but ill remind him
1, owen i have no need for a protocol droid
1, threepio sir  not in an environment such as this  thats why ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that
1, owen what i really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators
1, threepio vaporators  sir  my first job was programming binary load lifters very similar to your vaporators  you could say
1, owen do you speak bocce
1, threepio of course i can sir  its like a second language for me  im as fluent in bocce
1, owen all right shut up ill take this one
1, threepio shutting up sir
1, owen luke take these two over to the garage will you  i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner
1, luke but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters
1, owen you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done  now come on get to it
1, luke all right come on  and the red one come on  well come on red lets go
1, luke uncle owen
1, owen yeah
1, luke this r unit has a bad motivator  look
1, owen hey whatre you trying to push on us
1, threepio excuse me sir but that r unit is in prime condition  a real bargain
1, luke uncle owen
1, owen yeah
1, luke what about that one
1, owen what about that blue one  well take that one
1, luke yeah take it away
1, threepio uh im quite sure youll be very pleased with that one sir  he really is in firstclass condition  ive worked with him before  here he comes
1, luke okay lets go
1, threepio now dont forget this  why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity
1, threepio thank the maker  this oil bath is going to feel so good  ive got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move
1, luke it just isnt fair  oh biggs is right  im never gonna get out of here
1, threepio is there anything i might do to help 
1, luke well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock
1, threepio i dont think so sir  im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things  not on this planet anyways  as a matter of fact im not even sure which planet im on
1, luke well if theres a bright center to the universe youre on the planet that its farthest from
1, threepio i see sir
1, luke uh you can call me luke
1, threepio i see sir luke
1, luke just luke
1, threepio and i am seethreepio humancyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoodetoo
1, luke hello
1, luke you got a lot of carbon scoring here  it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action
1, threepio with all weve been through sometimes im amazed were in as good condition as we are what with the rebellion and all
1, luke you know of the rebellion against the empire
1, threepio thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir
1, luke have you been in many battles
1, threepio several i think  actually theres not much to tell  im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories  well not at making them interesting anyways
1, luke well my little friend youve got something jammed in here real good  were you on a starcruiser or
1, leia help me obiwan kenobi  youremy only hope
1, luke whats this
1, threepio what is what  he asked you a questionwhat is that
1, leia help me obiwan kenobi  youre my only hope  help me obiwan kenobi  youre my only hope
1, threepio oh he says its nothing sir  merely a malfunction  old data  pay it no mind
1, luke who is she  shes beautiful
1, threepio im afraid im not quite sure sir
1, leia help me obiwan kenobi
1, threepio i think she was a passenger on our last voyage  a person of some importance sir  i believe  our captain was attached to
1, luke is there more to this recording
1, threepio behave yourself artoo  youre going to get us in trouble  its all right you can trust him  hes our new master
1, threepio he says hes the property of obiwan kenobi a resident of these parts  and its a private message for him  quite frankly sir i dont know what hes talking about  our last master was captain antilles but with what weve been through this little r unit has become a bit eccentric
1, luke obiwan kenobi  i wonder if he means old ben kenobi
1, threepio i beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about
1, luke well i dont know anyone named obiwan but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea  hes kind of a strange old hermit
1, luke i wonder who she is  it sounds like shes in trouble  id better play back the whole thing
1, threepio he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system  he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
1, luke hm  oh yeah well i guess youre too small to run away on me if i take this off  okay
1, luke there you go
1, luke well wait a minute  whered she go  bring her back  play back the entire message
1, threepio been playing  the one youre carrying inside your rusty innards 
1, aunt beru luke  luke  come to dinner
1, luke all right ill be right there aunt beru
1, threepio im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter
1, luke well see what you can do with him  ill be right back
1, threepio just you reconsider playing that message for him
1, threepio no i dont think he likes you at all
1, threepio no i dont like you either
1, luke you know i think that r unit we bought might have been stolen
1, owen what makes you think that
1, luke well i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him  he says he belongs to someone called obiwan kenobi
1, luke i thought he might have meant ben  do you know what hes talking about  well i wonder if hes related to ben
1, owen that old mans just a crazy wizard  tomorrow i want you to take that r unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed  thatll be the end of it  it belongs to us now
1, luke but what if this obiwan comes looking for him
1, owen he wont i dont think he exists any more  he died about the same time as your father
1, luke he knew my father
1, owen i told you to forget it  your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow  in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers
1, luke yes sir  i think those new droids are going to work out fine  in fact i uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season  and if these new droids do work out i want to transmit my application to the academy this year
1, owen you mean the next semester before harvest
1, luke sure therere more than enough droids
1, owen harvest is when i need you the most  only one more season  this year well make enough on the harvest so ill be able to hire some more hands  and then you can go to the academy next year
1, owen you must understand i need you here luke
1, luke but its a whole nother year
1, owen look its only one more season
1, luke yeah thats what you said last year when biggs and tank left
1, aunt beru where are you going
1, luke it looks like im going nowhere  i have to finish cleaning those droids
1, aunt beru owen he cant stay here forever  most of his friends have gone  it means so much to him
1, owen ill make it up to him next year  i promise
1, aunt beru lukes just not a farmer owen  he has too much of his father in him
1, owen thats what im afraid of
1, luke what are you doing hiding there
1, threepio it wasnt my fault sir  please dont deactivate me  i told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission
1, luke oh no
1, threepio that r unit has always been a problem  these astrodroids are getting quite out of hand  even i cant understand their logic at times 
1, luke how could i be so stupid  hes nowhere in sight  blast it
1, threepio pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him
1, luke its too dangerous with all the sand people around  well have to wait until morning
1, owen luke im shutting the power down for the night
1, luke all right ill be there in a few minutes  boy am i gonna get it
1, luke you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble
1, threepio oh he excels at that sir
1, owen luke  luke  luke  where could he be loafing now
1, owen have you seen luke this morning
1, aunt beru he said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early
1, owen uh  did he take those two new droids with him
1, aunt beru i think so
1, owen well hed better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or therell be hell to pay
1, luke hows that
1, luke old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but i dont see how that r unit could have come this far  we must have missed him  uncle owen isnt going to take this very well
1, threepio sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
1, luke sure  he needs you  hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so
1, threepio deactivate  well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt
1, luke wait theres something dead ahead on the scanner  it looks like our droid hit the accelerator
1, luke hey whoa just where do you think youre going
1, threepio master luke here is your rightful owner  well have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish and dont talk to me of your mission either  youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here
1, luke well come on its getting late  i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up
1, threepio if you dont mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop
1, luke no hes not going to try anything
1, luke whats wrong with him now
1, threepio oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
1, luke sand people  or worse  come on lets have a look  come on
1, luke there are two banthas down there but i dont see any wait a second theyre sand people all right  i can see one of them now
1, ben hello there  come here my little friend  dont be afraid
1, ben dont worry hell be all right
1, luke what happened
1, ben rest easy son youve had a busy day  youre fortunate youre still in one piece
1, luke ben  ben kenobi  boy am i glad to see you 
1, ben the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly  tell me young luke what brings you out this far
1, luke oh this little droid  i think hes searching for his former master  ive never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems tobe no stopping him  he claims to be the property of an obiwan kenobi  is he a relative of yours  do you know who hes talking about
1, ben obiwan kenobi obiwan  now thats a name i havent heard in a long time a long time
1, luke i think my uncle knew him  he said he was dead
1, ben oh hes not dead no not yet
1, luke you know him
1, ben well of course of course i know him  hes me  i havent gone by the name obiwan since oh before you were born
1, luke then the droid does belong to you
1, ben dont seem to remember ever owning a droid  very interesting 
1, ben i think we better get indoors  the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
1, luke  threepio
1, threepio where am i  i must have taken a bad step
1, luke can you stand  weve got to get out of here before the sand people return
1, threepio i dont think i can make it  you go on master luke  theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account  im done for
1, luke no youre not  what kind of talk is that
1, ben quickly son theyre on the move
1, luke no my father didnt fight in the wars  he was a navigator on a spice freighter
1, ben thats what your uncle told you  he didnt hold with your fathers ideals  thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
1, luke you fought in the clone wars
1, ben yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father
1, luke i wish id known him
1, ben he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior  i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself  and he was a good friend  which reminds me
1, ben i have something here for you  your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it  he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did 
1, threepio sir if youll not be needing me ill close down for awhile
1, luke sure go ahead
1, luke what is it
1, ben your fathers lightsaber  this is the weapon of a jedi knight  not as clumsy or as random as a blaster
1, ben an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time  for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic  before the dark times before the empire
1, luke how did my father die
1, ben a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights  he betrayed and murdered your father  now the jedi are all but extinct  vader was seduced by the dark side of the force
1, luke the force
1, ben well the force is what gives the jedi his power  its an energy field created by all living things  it surrounds us and penetrates us  it binds the galaxy together
1, ben now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend  and where you come from
1, luke i saw part of the message he was
1, ben i seem to have found it
1, leia general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars  now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire  i regret that i am unable to present my fathers request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and im afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed  i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r unit  my father will know how to retrieve it  you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan  this is our most desperate hour  help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope
1, ben you must learn the ways of the force if youre to come with me to alderaan
1, luke alderaan  im not going to alderaan  ive got to go home  its late im in for it as it is
1, ben i need your help luke  im getting too old for this sort of thingshe needs your help
1, luke i cant get involved  ive got work to do  its not that i like the empire  i hate it  but theres nothing i can do about it right now  its such a long way from here
1, ben thats your uncle talking
1, luke oh god my uncle  how am i ever going to explain this
1, ben learn about the force luke
1, luke look i can take you as far as anchorhead  you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever youre going
1, ben you must do what you feel is right of course
1, tagge until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable  the rebel alliance is too well equipped  theyre more dangerous than you realize
1, motti dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station
1, tagge the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate as long as
1, tarkin the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us  ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently  the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away
1, tagge thats impossible  how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy
1, tarkin the regional governors now have direct control over territories  fear will keep the local systems in line  fear of this battle station
1, tagge and what of the rebellion  if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it
1, vader the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands
1, motti any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data theyve obtained  this station is now the ultimate power in the universe  i suggest we use it
1, vader dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed  the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force
1, motti dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways lord vader  your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fort
1, vader i find your lack of faith disturbing
1, tarkin enough of this  vader release him
1, vader as you wish
1, tarkin this bickering is pointless  lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational  we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke
1, luke it looks like sand people did this all right  look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks  its just i never heard of them hitting anything this big before
1, ben they didnt  but we are meant to think they did  these tracks are side by side  sand people always ride single file to hide there numbers
1, luke these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio
1, ben and these blast points too accurate for sand people  only imperial stormtroopers are so precise
1, luke why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas
1, luke if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to  and that would lead them back home
1, ben wait luke  its too dangerous
1, luke uncle owen  aunt beru  uncle owen
1, vader and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base
1, ben theres nothing you could have done luke had you been there  youd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire
1, luke i want to come with you to alderaan  theres nothing here for me now  i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father
1, ben mos eisley spaceport  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy  we must be cautious
1, trooper how long have you had these droids
1, luke about three or four seasons
1, ben theyre for sale if you want them
1, trooper let me see your identification
1, ben you dont need to see his identification
1, trooper we dont need to see his identification
1, ben looking for
1, trooper these are not the droids were looking for
1, ben he can go about his business
1, trooper you can go about your business
1, ben move along
1, trooper move along  move along
1, threepio i cant abide these jawas  disgusting creatures
1, luke go on go on  i cant understand how we got by those troopers  i thought we were dead
1, ben the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded  you will find it a powerful ally
1, luke do you really think were going to find a pilot here thatll take us to alderaan
1, ben well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here  only watch your step  this place can be a little rough
1, luke im ready for anything
1, threepio come along artoo
1, bartender we dont serve their kind here
1, luke what
1, bartender your droids theyll have to wait outside  we dont want them here
1, luke listen why dont you wait out by the speeder  we dont want any trouble
1, threepio i heartily agree with you sir
1, creature negola dewaghi wooldugger
1, human he doesnt like you
1, luke im sorry
1, human i dont like you either
1, human dont insult us  you just watch yourself  were wanted men  i have the death sentence on twelve systems
1, luke ill be careful than
1, human youll be dead
1, ben this little one isnt worth the effort  come let me buy you something
1, bartender no blasters  no blaster
1, ben this is chewbacca  hes firstmate on a ship that might suit our needs
1, threepio i dont like the look of this
1, han han solo  im captain of the millennium falcon  chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the alderaan system
1, ben yes indeed  if its a fast ship
1, han fast ship  youve never heard of the millennium falcon
1, ben should i have
1, han its the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
1, han ive outrun imperial starships not the local bulkcruisers mind you  im talking about the big corellian ships now  shes fast enough for you old man  whats the cargo
1, ben only passengers  myself the boy two droids and no questions asked
1, han what is it  some kind of local trouble
1, ben lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements
1, han well thats the real trick isnt it  and its going to cost you something extra  ten thousand in advance
1, luke ten thousand  we could almost buy our own ship for that
1, han but whos going to fly it kid  you
1, luke you bet i could  im not such a bad pilot myself  we dont have to sit here and listen
1, ben we havent that much with us  but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
1, han seventeen huh
1, han okay  you guys got yourself a ship  well leave as soon as youre ready  docking bay ninetyfour
1, ben ninetyfour
1, han looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
1, trooper all right well check it out
1, han seventeen thousand  those guys must really be desperate  this could really save my neck  get back to the ship and get her ready
1, ben youll have to sell your speeder
1, luke thats okay  im never coming back to this planet again
1, greedo going somewhere solo
1, han yes greedo  as a matter of fact i was just going to see your boss  tell jabba that ive got his money
1, greedo its too late  you should have paid him when you had the chance  jabbas put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you  im lucky i found you first
1, han yeah but this time i got the money
1, greedo if you give it to me i might forget i found you
1, han i dont have it with me  tell jabba
1, greedo jabbas through with you  he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser
1, han even i get boarded sometimes  do you think i had a choice
1, greedo you can tell that to jabba  he may only take your ship
1, han over my dead body
1, greedo thats the idea ive been looking forward to killing you for a long time
1, han yes ill bet you have
1, han sorry about the mess
1, vader her resistance to the mind probe is considerable  it will be some time before we can extract any information from her
1, imperial officer the final checkout is complete  all systems are operational  what course shall we set
1, tarkin perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion
1, vader what do you mean
1, tarkin i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this stationset your course for princess leias home planet of alderaan
1, trooper with pleasure
1, threepio lock the door artoo
1, trooper all right check that side of the street  its secure  move on to the next door
1, threepio i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you  i dont know what all this trouble is about but im sure it must be your fault
1, threepio you watch your language
1, luke he says its the best he can do  since the xp came out they 
1, ben it will be enough
1, ben if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well
1, jabba come on out solo
1, han ive been waiting for you jabba
1, jabba i expected you would be
1, han im not the type to run
1, jabba han my boy there are times when you disappoint me why havent you paid me  and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that after all weve been through together
1, han you sent greedo to blast me
1, jabba han why youre the best smuggler in the business  youre too valuable to fry  he was only relaying my concern at your delays  he wasnt going to blast you
1, han i think he thought he was  next time dont send one of those twerps  if youve got something to say to me come see me yourself
1, jabba han han  if only you hadnt had to dump that shipment of spice you understand i just cant make an exception  where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship  its not good business
1, han you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba  i had no choice but ive gota charter now and i can pay you back plus a little extra  i just need some more time
1, jabba put your blasters away  han my boy im only doing this because youre the best and i need you  so for an extra say twenty percent ill give you a little more time but this is it  if you disappoint me again ill put a price on your head so large you wont be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life
1, han jabba ill pay you because its my pleasure
1, luke what a piece of junk
1, han shell make point five beyond the speed of light  she may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid  ive added some special modifications myself
1, han were a little rushed so if youll hurry aboard well get out of here
1, threepio hello sir
1, trooper which way
1, trooper all right men  load your weapons
1, trooper stop that ship
1, trooper blast em
1, han chewie get us out of here
1, threepio oh my  id forgotten how much i hate space travel
1, han it looks like an imperial cruiser  our passengers must be hotter than i thought  try and hold them off  angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed
1, han stay sharp  there are two more coming in theyre going to try to cut us off
1, luke why dont you outrun them  i thought you said this thing was fast
1, han watch your mouth kid or youre going to find yourself floating home  well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace  besides i know a few maneuvers well lose them
1, han heres where the fun begins
1, ben how long before you can make the jump to light speed
1, han itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer
1, luke are you kidding  at the rate theyre gaining
1, han traveling through hyperspace isnt like dusting crops boy  without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick wouldnt it
1, luke whats that flashing
1, han were losing our deflector shield  go strap yourself in im going to make the jump to light speed
1, motti weve entered the alderaan system
1, leia governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vaders leash  i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board
1, tarkin charming to the last  you dont know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life
1, leia to take the responsibility yourself
1, tarkin princess leia before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational  no star system will dare oppose the emperor now
1, leia the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers
1, tarkin not after we demonstrate the power of this station  in a way you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first  since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base i have chosen to test this stations destructive power on your home planet of alderaan
1, leia no  alderaan is peaceful  we have no weapons  you cant possibly
1, tarkin you would prefer another target  a military target  then name the system
1, tarkin i grow tired of asking this  so itll be the last time  where is the rebel base
1, leia dantooine
1, leia theyre on dantooine
1, tarkin there  you see lord vader she can be reasonable continue with the operation  you may fire when ready
1, leia what
1, tarkin youre far too trusting  dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration  but dont worry  we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough 
1, leia no
1, vader commence primary ignition
1, luke are you all right  whats wrong
1, ben i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced  i fear something terrible has happened
1, ben youd better get on with your exercises
1, han well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  i told you id outrun em
1, han dont everyone thank me at once
1, han anyway we should be at alderaan about ohtwohundred hours
1, threepio now be careful artoo
1, threepio he made a fair move  screaming about it wont help you
1, han let him have it its not wise to upset a wookiee
1, threepio but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
1, han thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose  wookiees are known to do that
1, threepio i see your point sir  i suggest a new strategy artoo  let the wookiee win
1, ben remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him
1, luke you mean it controls your actions
1, ben partially but it also obeys your commands
1, han hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid
1, luke you dont believe in the force do you
1, han kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  ive seen a lot of strange stuff but ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one allpowerful force controlling everything  theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny
1, han its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
1, ben i suggest you try it again luke
1, ben this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct
1, luke with the blast shield down i cant even see  how am i supposed to fight
1, ben your eyes can deceive you  dont trust them
1, ben stretch out with your feelings
1, ben you see you can do it
1, han i call it luck 
1, ben in my experience theres no such thing as luck
1, han look going good against remotes is one thing  going good against the living  thats something else
1, han looks like were coming up on alderaan
1, luke you know i did feel something  i could almost see the remote
1, ben thats good  you have taken your first step into a larger world
1, tarkin yes
1, officer cass our scout ships have reached dantooine  they found the remains of a rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time  they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems
1, tarkin she lied  she lied to us
1, vader i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion
1, tarkin terminate her immediately
1, han stand by chewie here we go  cut in the sublight engines
1, han what the  aw weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower  some kind of asteroid collision  its not on any of the charts
1, luke whats going on
1, han our position is correct except no alderaan
1, luke what do you mean  where is it
1, han thats what im trying to tell you kid  it aint there  its been totally blown away
1, luke what  how
1, ben destroyed by the empire
1, han the entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet  itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than ive
1, han theres another ship coming in
1, luke maybe they know what happened
1, ben its an imperial fighter
1, luke it followed us
1, ben no  its a short range fighter
1, han there arent any bases around here  where did it come from
1, luke it sure is leaving in a big hurry  if they identify us were in big trouble
1, han not if i can help it  chewie jam its transmissions
1, ben itd be as well to let it go  its too far out of range
1, han not for long
1, ben a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own
1, luke then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something
1, han well he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
1, luke look at him  hes heading for that small moon
1, han i think i can get him before he gets there hes almost in range
1, ben thats no moon  its a space station
1, han its too big to be a space station
1, luke i have a very bad feeling about this
1, ben turn the ship around
1, han yeah i think your right  full reverse  chewie lock in the auxiliary power
1, luke why are we still moving towards it
1, han were caught in a tractor beam  its pulling us in
1, luke but theres gotta be something you can do
1, han theres nothin i can do about it kid  im in full power  im going to have to shut down  but theyre not going to get me without a fight
1, ben you cant win  but there are alternatives to fighting
1, voice over death star intercom clear bay twentythreeseven  we are opening the magnetic field
1, officer to your stations
1, officer come with me
1, officer close all outboard shields  close all outboard shields
1, tarkin yes
1, voice weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system  its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley
1, vader they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess  she may yet be of some use to us
1, voice unlock onefiveseven and nine release charges
1, officer theres no one on board sir  according to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff  it must be a decoy sir  several of the escape pods have been jettisoned
1, vader did you find any droids
1, officer no sir  if there were any on board they must also have jettisoned
1, vader send a scanning crew on board  i want every part of this ship checked
1, officer yes sir
1, vader i sense something a presence i havent felt since
1, officer get me a scanning crew in here on the double  i want every part of this ship checked
1, luke boy its lucky you had these compartments
1, han i use them for smuggling  i never thought id be smuggling myself in them  this is ridiculous  even if i could take off id never get past the tractor beam
1, ben leave that to me
1, han damn fool i knew that you were going to say that
1, ben whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him
1, trooper the ships all yours  if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately  all right lets go
1, han hey down there could you give us a hand with this
1, gantry officer txfouronetwo  why arent you at your post  txfouronetwo do you copy 
1, gantry officer take over  weve got a bad transmitter  ill see what i can do
1, luke you know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here
1, han bring them on  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
1, threepio we found the computer outlet sir
1, ben plug in  he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network
1, threepio he says hes found the main control to the power beam thats holding the ship here  hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor
1, threepio the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations  a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave
1, ben i dont think you boys can help  i must go alone
1, han whatever you say  ive done more than i bargained for on this trip already
1, luke i want to go with you
1, ben be patient luke  stay and watch over the droids
1, luke but he can
1, ben they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan  your destiny lies along a different path from mine  the force will be with you always
1, han boy you said it chewie
1, han where did you dig up that old fossil
1, luke ben is a great man
1, han yeah great at getting us into trouble
1, luke i didnt hear you give any ideas
1, han well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up
1, luke who do you think
1, luke what is it
1, threepio im afraid im not quite sure sir he says i found her and keepsrepeating shes here
1, luke well who who has he found

1, han now look dont get any funny ideas  the old man wants us to wait right here
1, luke but he didnt know she was here  look will you just find a way back into the detention block
1, han im not going anywhere
1, luke theyre going to execute her  look a few minutes ago you said you didnt want to just wait here to be captured  now all you want to do is stay

1, threepio that isnt very reassuring
1, luke i cant see a thing in this helmet
1, han this is not going to work

1, leia put that thing away  youre going to get us all killed
1, han absolutely your worship  look i had everything under control until you led us down here  you know its not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us

1, luke good
1, han still shes got a lot of spirit  i dont know what do you think  do you think a princess and a guy like me
1, luke no
1, willard youre safe  we had feared the worst
1, willard when we heard about alderaan we were afraid that you were lost along with your father
1, leia we dont have time for our sorrows commander  the battle station has surely tracked us hereits the only explanation for the ease of our escape  you must use the information in this r unit to plan the attack  it is our only hope
1, tarkin yes
1, death star intercom voice we are approaching the planet yavin  the rebel base is on a moon on the far side  we are preparing to orbit the planet
1, dodonna the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleetits defenses are designed around a direct largescale assault  a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense
1, gold leader pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that
1, dodonna well the empire doesnt consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat or theyd have a tighter defense  an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station
1, dodonna the approach will not be easy  you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point  the target area is only two meters wide  its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port  the shaft leads directly to the reactor system  a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station
1, dodonna only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction  the shaft is rayshielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes
1, wedge thats impossible even for a computer
1, luke its not impossible  i used to bullseye womp rats in my tsixteen back home  theyre not much bigger than two meters
1, dodonna man your ships  and may the force be with you
1, death star intercom voice orbiting the planet at maximum velocity  the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes
1, vader this will be a day long remembered  it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion
1, man all flight troops man your stations  all flight troops man your stations
1, luke so you got your reward and youre just leaving then
1, han thats right yeah  i got some old debts ive got to pay off with this stuff  even if i didnt you dont think id be fool enough to stick around here do you  why dont you come with us  youre pretty good in a fight  i could use you
1, luke come on  why dont you take a look around  you know whats about to happen what theyre up against  they could use a good pilot like you  youre turning your back on them
1, han what goods a reward if you aint around to use it  besides attacking that battle station aintmy idea of courage  its more like suicide
1, luke all right  well take care of yourself han guess thats what youre best at isnt it
1, han hey luke may the force be with you
1, han whatre you lookin at  i know what im doing

1, leia the cave is collapsing
1, han this is no cave

1, luke vader is the dark side stronger
1, yoda nonono quicker easier more seductive
1, luke but how am i to know the good side from the bad
1, yoda you will know when you are calm at peace passive a jedi uses  the force for knowledge and defense never for attack
1, luke but tell me why i cant
1, yoda no no there is no why nothing more will i  teach you today clear your mind of questions mmm mmmmmm
1, luke theres something not right here
1, luke i feel cold death
1, yoda that placeis strong with the dark side of the force a domain  of evil it is in you must go
1, luke whats in there

1, leia no lightspeed
1, han its not my fault
1, threepio sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield one more  direct hit on the back quarter and were done for
1, han turn her around
1, han i said turn her around im going to put all power in the front  shield

1, threepio sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial  star destroyer
1, leia shut up

1, needa track them they may come around for another pass
1, tracking officer captain needa the ship no longer appears on our  scopes
1, needa they cant have disappeared no ship that small has a cloaking  device
1, tracking officer well theres no trace of them sir

1, luke i cant its too big
1, yoda size matters not look at me judge me by my size do you hm  mmmm

1, luke i donti dont believe it
1, yoda that is why you fail
1, vader apology accepted captain needa
1, piett lord vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing if the millennium falcon went into lightspeed itll be on the other side of the galaxy by now

1, threepio i really dont see how thats going to help surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances the empire may be gracious enough
1, han thank you
1, leia what did you have in mind for your next move
1, han well if they follow standard imperial procedure theyll dump  their garbage before they go to lightspeed then we just float away

1, ben luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost  vader
1, luke you wont
1, yoda stopped they must be on this depends only a fully trained jedi  knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor if you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path as vader did you will become an agent of evil
1, ben patience
1, luke and sacrifice han and leia
1, yoda if you honor what they fight foryes
1, ben if you choose to face vader you will do it alone i cannot  interfere

1, lando having trouble with you droid
1, han no no problem why
1, lando so you see since were a small operation we dont fall into  theuhjurisdiction of the empire
1, leia so youre part of the mining guild then
1, lando no not actually our operation is small enough not to be  noticedwhich is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves
1, han arent you afraid the empires going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down
1, lando thats always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything weve built here but things have developed that will insure security ive just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever
1, vader we would be honored if you would join us
1, lando i had no choice they arrived right before you did im sorry
1, han im sorry too
1, luke no threepios with them

1, vader he will not be permanently damaged
1, lando lord vader what about leia and the wookiee
1, vader they must never again leave this city
1, lando that was never a condition of our agreement nor was giving han  to this bounty hunter
1, vader perhaps you think youre being treated unfairly
1, lando no
1, vader good it would be unfortunate if i had to leave a garrison  here
1, lando this deals getting worse all the time
1, threepio oh yes thats very good i like that oh somethings not  right because now i cant see wait wait oh my what have you done im backwards you stupid furball only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough

1, imperial soldier lord vader ship approaching xwing class
1, vader good monitor skywalker and allow him to land
1, lando lord vader we only use this facility for carbon freezing if  you put him in there it might kill him
1, vader i do not want the emperors prize damaged we will test iton  captain solo
1, threepio if only you had attached my legs i wouldnt be in this  ridiculous position now remember chewbacca you have a responsibility to me so dont do anything foolish
1, han whats going onbuddy
1, lando youre being put into carbon freeze
1, boba fett what if he doesnt survive hes worth a lot to me
1, vader the empire will compensate you if he dies put him in
1, threepio oh no no no no stop chewbacca stop

1, emperor rise my friend
1, vader the death star will be completed on schedule
1, emperor you have done well lord vader and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker
1, vader yes my master
1, emperor patience my friend in time he will seek you out and when he does you must bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force
1, vader as you wish
1, emperor everything is proceeding as i have foreseen
1, yoda hmm that face you make look i so old to young eyes
1, luke no of course not
1, yoda i do yes i do  sick have i become old and weak  when nine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not hmm
1, yoda soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have
1, luke master yoda you cant die
1, yoda strong am i with the force but not that strong twilight is upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of things  the way of the force
1, luke but i need your help ive come back to complete the training
1, yoda no more training do you require already know you that which you need
1, luke then i am a jedi
1, yoda ohhh not yet one thing remains vader you must confront vader then only then a jedi will you be and confront him you will
1, luke master yoda is darth vader my father
1, yoda mmm rest i need yes rest
1, luke yoda i must know
1, yoda your father he is
1, yoda told you did he
1, luke yes
1, yoda unexpected this is and unfortunate
1, luke unfortunate that i know the truth
1, yoda no unfortunate that you rushed to face him that incomplete was your training not ready for the burden were you
1, luke well im sorry
1, yoda remember a jedis strength flows from the force  but beware  anger fear aggression the dark side are they  once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny
1, yoda lukelukedo notdo not underestimate the powers of the emperor or suffer your fathers fate you will luke when gone am i  the last of the jedi will you be luke the force runs strong in your family pass on what you have learned luke  there is anotherskyskywalker
1, luke i cant do it artoo i cant go on alone
1, ben yoda will always be with you
1, luke obiwan why didnt you tell me
1, luke you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father
1, ben you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view
1, luke a certain point of view
1, ben luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view
1, ben i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault
1, ben anakin was a good friend
1, ben when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him  i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi  i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda  i was wrong  my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy
1, luke theres still good in him
1, ben i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil
1, luke i cant do it ben
1, ben you cannot escape your destiny
1, luke i tried to stop him once i couldnt do it
1, ben vader humbled you when first you met him lukebut that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience  had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared
1, luke but i had to help my friends
1, ben and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear
1, luke i found out darth vader was my father
1, ben to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door  for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again
1, luke i cant kill my own father
1, ben then the emperor has already won you were our only hope
1, luke yoda spoke of another
1, ben the other he spoke of is your twin sister
1, luke but i have no sister
1, ben hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous
1, luke leia leias my sister
1, ben your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor
1, ben when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible  so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan
1, ben the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy  even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well  thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause  thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate
1, luke but you cant let her get involved now ben vader will destroy her
1, ben she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke  but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader
1, han well look at you a general huh
1, lando oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab
1, han well dont look at me pal i just said you were a fair pilot i didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack
1, lando im surprised they didnt ask you to do it
1, han well who says they didnt  but i aint crazy youre the respectable one remember
1, mon mothma the emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come
1, mon mothma the data brought to us by the bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the emperors new battle station we also know that the weapon systems of this death star are not yet operational with the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected but most important of all weve learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star
1, mon mothma many bothans died to bring us this information admiral ackbar please
1, ackbar you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational the death star does have a strong defense mechanism it is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor
1, ackbar general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
1, han good luck
1, han youre gonna need it
1, ackbar general madine
1, general madine we have stolen a small imperial shuttle disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator
1, threepio sounds dangerous
1, leia i wonder who they found to pull that off
1, general madine general solo is your strike team assembled
1, han uh my teams ready i dont have a command crew for the shuttle
1, han well its gonna be rough pal i didnt want to speak for you
1, han thats one
1, leia uh general count me in
1, voice im with you too
1, leia what is it
1, luke ask me again sometime
1, han luke

1, vader what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust
1, emperor it is of no concern soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us your work here is finished my friend go out to the command ship and await my orders

1,despite the pain she is strong
1,on rens face as his confidence begins to melt away he has
1,slammed up against a barrier in her mind he looks less
1,certain by the moment as rey seems to grow in strength the
1,ferocity of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass
1,and rey does the unthinkable she enters his head amazed
1,at what she is seeing

1,rey master skywalker we need you to bring the jedi back because kylo ren is strong with the dark side of the force without the jedi we wont stand a chance against him
1,luke what do you know about the force
1,rey its a power that jedi have that lets them control people and make things float
1,luke impressive every word in that sentence was wrong lesson one sit here legs crossed the force is not a power you have its not about lifting rocks its the energy between all things a tension a balance that binds the universe together
1,rey ok but what is it
1,luke close your eyes breathe now reach out
1,rey i feel something

1,luke lesson two now that theyre extinct the jedi are romanticized defied but if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds the legacy of the jedi is failure hypocrisy hubris rey thats not true luke at the height of their powers they allowed darth sidious to rise create the empire and wipe them out it was a jedi master who was responsible for the training and creation of darth vader rey and a jedi who saved him yes the most hated man in the galaxy but you saw that there was conflict inside him you believed that he wasnt gone that he could be turned luke and i became a legend for many years there was balance and then i saw ben my nephew with that mighty skywalker blood and in my hubris i thought i could train him i could pass on my strengths han was han about it but leia trusted me with her son i took him and a dozen students and began a training temple by the time i realized i was no match for the darkness rising in him it was too late rey what happened luke i went to confront him and he turned on me ben no he must have thought i was dead when i came to the temple was burning he had vanished with a handful of my students and slaughtered the rest leia blamed snoke but it was me i failed because i was luke skywalker jedi master a legend rey the galaxy may need a legend i need someone to show me my place in all this and you didnt fail kylo kylo failed you i wont

1,jyn erso  years ago
1,cassian andor any idea where he  s been all that time
1,jyn erso i like to think he  s dead makes things easier
1,cassian andor easier than what that he  s being a tool of the imperial war machine
1,jyn erso i  ve never had the luxury of political opinions

1,cassian andor there  s an imperial defector in jedha a pilot he  s being held by saw gerrera he  s claiming the emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets the pilot says he was sent by your father
1,senator mon mothma we need to stop this weapon before it is finished
1,general davits draven captain andor  s mission is to authenticate the pilot  s story and then if possible find your father
1,senator mon mothma it appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon given the gravity of the situation and your history with sawwe  re hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the senate for testimony

1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin most unfortunate about the security breach on jedha director krennic after so many setbacks and delays and now this we  ve heard word of rumors circulating through the city apparently you  ve lost a rather talkative cargo pilot if the senate gets wind of our project countless systems will flock to the rebellion
1,director orson krennic when the battle station is finished governor tarkin the senate will be of little concern
1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin when has become now director krennic the emperor will tolerate no further delay you have made time an ally of the rebellion i suggest we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience

1,galen erso saw if you  re watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the alliance perhaps there  s a chance to explain myself and though i don   dare hope for too much a chance for jyn if she  s alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately i  ve missed her jyn my stardust i can   imagine what you think of me when i was taken i faced some bitter truths i was told that soon enough krennic would have you as well as time went by i knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you i knew if i refused to work if i took my own life it would only be a matter of time before krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project so i did the one thing that nobody expected i lied i learned to lie i played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work i made myself indispensable and all the while i laid the groundwork of my revenge we call it the death star there is no better name and the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed i  ve placed a weakness deep within the system a flaw so small and powerful they  ll never find it but jyn jyn if you  re listening my beloved so much of my life has been wasted i try to think of you only in the moments when i  m strong because the pain of not having you with me your mother our family the pain of that loss is so overwhelming i risk failing even now it  s just so hard not to think of you think of where you are my stardust saw the reactor module that  s the key that  s the place i  ve laid my trap it  s well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station

1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin i will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the rebellion
1,director orson krennic that was only an inkling of its destructive potential
1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin i will tell him that i will be taking control over the weapon i first spoke of years ago effective immediately
1,krennics face turns into a grimace he starts yelling at tarkin
1,director orson krennic we stand here amid my achievement not yours
1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin i  m afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director
1,director orson krennic the breaches have been filled jedha has been silenced

1,cassian andor he did build it
1,jyn erso because he knew they  d do it without him my father made a choice he sacrificed himself for the rebellion he  s rigged a trap inside it that  s why he sent you to bring that message
1,cassian andor where is it where  s the message

1,cassian andor i  ve done that
1,jyn erso they have to know there  s a way to destroy this thing they have to go to scarif to get the plans

1,the shuttle sails through hyperspace with engines whooshing loudly it jumps out of hyperspace and the camera pans to follow it across the surface of the large tropical planet of scarif a blockade of two star destroyers and a defensive shield hangs above the surface
1,bodhi rook okay we  re coming in there  s a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate this shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through
1,kso kaytuesso assuming the empire hasn   logged it as overdue
1,bodhi rook or stolen
1,jyn erso and if they have
1,bodhi rook then they shut the gate and we  re all annihilated in the cold dark vacuum of space
1,the shuttle passes under the massive hull of a star destroyer
1,kso kaytuesso not me i can survive in space
1,bodhi rook okay here it goes
1,he contacts the shield gate via comms
1,bodhi rook cargo shuttle sw requesting a landing pad
1,shield gate officer cargo shuttle sw you  re not listed on the arrival schedule

1,flight controller sw clear for landing pad  acknowledge please
1,bodhi rook sw proceeding to lp as instructed
1,the shuttle gets closer to the surface and a tall pyramidal tower with a dish at the top comes into view
1,cassian andor the main building down there what is it
1,bodhi rook that  s the citadel tower they keep all the imperial structure archives in there if the plans are anywhere they  ll be there
1,cassian andor the dish at the top what  s it for
1,bodhi rook i guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out
1,kso kaytuesso landing track engaged
1,bodhi rook landing track locked
1,downstairs jyn notices the rebels silently sitting in the hold of the shuttle all looking tense and worried she catches bazes eye as cassian climbs down to make an announcement
1,cassian andor we  re landing we  re coming in
1,jyn gets up swallows and starts speaking to lift the morale as she begins rebels lift their heads to listen
1,jyn erso saw gerrera used to say one fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day they have no idea we  re coming they have no reason to expect us if we can make it to the ground we  ll take the next chance and the next on and on until we win or the chances are spent the death star plans are down there cassian k and i will find them we  ll find a way to find them

1,landing pad officer that would be helpful
1,bodhi rook it  s just down here

1,the rebels open a hatch at the bottom of the shuttle and jump onto the ground scattering in their assigned positions in turn jyn and cassian in imperial disguise and kso walk out of the shuttle and head towards the elevator that will take them to the facility as the rebels disappear into the tropical forest kso jyn and cassian walk into the elevator and watch the doors close
1,kso kaytuesso i have a bad feeling about

1,kso kaytuesso well i  m sure there  s one just lying about
1,cassian andor you know what you have to do
1,the elevator door opens and they walk out into a hallway of the facility full of imperial officers and stormtroopers on their way they pass a droid identical to kso and exchange glances when he walks by meanwhile the rebel assault team is giving out thermal detonators as they watch an imperial hangar in the distance
1,sergeant ruescott melshi one per pad pick your spot we want to draw them out i  ll call the timing go
1,stormtroopers walk across the hangar chatting peacefully

1,stormtrooper  oh boy it  s about time for that
1,stormtrooper  hey
1,they dont even have time to react when chirrut jumps out of the bushes and knocks them out with his staff then disappears just as quickly the rebel forces run by unnoticed another stormtrooper hears someone coughing behind him and turns around to see baze just before he is dropped to the ground rebels plant their detonators on the landing pads and scatter
1,stormtrooper  watch out
1,stormtrooper  what the
1,the stormtrooper is electrocuted to the neck by baze cuts to krennic walking across the command centre of the tower followed by general ramda

1,cassian andor kay
1,kso kaytuesso our optimal route to the data vault places only  stormtroopers in our path we will make it no more than  of the way before we are killed

1,director orson krennic the shield is up your signal will never reach the rebel base all the ships in here will be destroyed i lose nothing but time you on the other hand die with the rebellion

1,in the elevator back to the landing pad cassian and jyn smile at each other weakly
1,cassian andor do you think anybody is listening
1,jyn erso i do someone  s out there
1,the mon cala cruiser has received the transmissions but someone catches a massive object on the horizon its the death star krennic opens his eyes and a look of horror flashes on his face as he sees it too
1,lieutenant sir we  re detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace
1,aboard the death sta stand tarkin and romodi ready to give the command to fire
1,general hurst romodi sir shall i begin targeting their fleet
1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin lord vader will handle the fleet target the base at scarif single reactor ignition
1,general hurst romodi yes sir
1,grand moff wilhuff tarkin you may fire when ready
1,general hurst romodi commence primary ignition
1,the death star control panels are ignited and the same green ray emerges from the reactor krennic watches silently as it fires destroying the antenna and hitting the ocean where a giant wave rises from the impact raddus watches the destruction from above
1,admiral raddus rogue one may the force be with you all ships prepare for jump to hyperspace
1,just before the fleet can make the jump the devastator jumps out of hyperspace and darth vader stands on the bridge as his isd destroys the remnants of the rebel fleet on the beach jyn and cassian hug as they fall ont othe sand and watch the wave come toward them
1,jyn erso i  m glad you came
1,cassian andor you father would have been proud of you jyn
1,the music intensifies and the two watch the wave with tears in their eyes as it engulfs them everything goes silent on board the devastator vader is preparing to board the cruiser
1,captain shaef corssin the rebel flag ship is disabled my lord but has received transmission from the surface
1,darth vader prepare a boarding party
1,captain shaef corssin yes my lord
1,on the cruiser the rebels barely get the plans onto a hard drive and race to the escape pods but some of them are cut off by a locked door

1,rebel it  s jammed
1,vader slaughters the rebels easily and cold bloodedly despite all their efforts someone manages to pass on the plans to the outside before being impaled by his saber the survivors run to the tantive iv thats docked to the cruiser

0,suddenly three borg drones converge on data with
0,various wickedlooking borg devices one of the borg
0,has a specialized cybernetic arm which extrudes a
0,series of stilettotipped drill spikes as the six
0,inch spikes begin to bore into datas head
0,cut to
0,ext montana resurrection city day
0,resurrection is a small town around people
0,a rural western community thats probably existed for
0,at least two hundred years and we can see the roots of
0,the original ranching community in some of the
0,architecture but its also a community of the st
0,century
0,the most striking feature of the town is that it sits
0,in the middle of nearly a hundred wind mills which
0,provide the only source of power for the town the
0,blades are enormous but the structures supporting them
0,are little more than simple poles some are sleek
0,fiberglass futuristic others have a more cobbled
0,together makeshift appearance at the moment only
0,a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze
0,picard and beverly emerge from the nearby woods
0,carrying the stretcher they exchange a look at the
0,sight of the city and then head toward it
0,ext resurrection city day
0,a few minutes later picard and beverly carrying
0,cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
0,end as they walk along we get our first taste of
0,postapocalyptic st century life
0,this is a recognizable american community but its
0,definitely a futuristic town clothing architecture
0,technology all have changed over the course of
0,seventy years but it is a broken future what used
0,to be hightech public computer terminals are rusted
0,and abandoned we can see the corroded hulks of hover
0,cars lying idle in the streets futuristic elements
0,now useless
0,at one point they pass a large polyurethane tent
0,the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
0,can see the silhouettes of people moving within the
0,entrance is guarded by a single militia guard later
0,we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse the
0,only place where they can grow uncontaminated food
0,what used to be a mcdonalds or some other
0,recognizable food chain has now been gutted and has
0,been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop people are
0,fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
0,tongs
0,the sidewalks are populated with people who congregate
0,in small groups quietly talking amongst themselves
0,others just staring vacantly off into space many of
0,them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies
0,victims of the war and postnuclear environmental
0,dangers a few of them are applying a special lotion
0,to their arms and face protection against the toxic
0,elements a long food line snakes around a block as
0,people line up to get their daily rations
0,a few people glance up at picard and beverly with
0,curious or suspicious looks this is not a community
0,that welcomes strangers at one point they see a man
0,dressed in futuristic camouflage carrying an automatic
0,weapon we will learn hes a militia soldier he
0,stares at them with a neutral expression then walks
0,off
0,the people here have that holloweyed listless look
0,about them theyre going through something that makes
0,the great depression look like a minor inconvenience
0,but theres also a toughness to these people a
0,resilience and determination to survive in the face of
0,overwhelming odds we are looking at our future and
0,its on the verge of collapse
0,cut to
0,int hospital emergency room day
0,a short time later cochrane is being lifted onto an
0,operating table picard and beverly step back from the
0,table as a doctor and two nurses look him over the
0,doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered
0,tired look to him the hospital itself is like the
0,rest of the town a futuristic setting fallen on hard
0,times the light in the room is provided mostly from
0,the sunlight streaming in through the windows light
0,bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital
0,we get the feeling they have very little power
0,doctor
0,how long has he been unconscious
0,beverly
0,at least four hours
0,he checks cochrans head injury as beverly takes out
0,her tricorder and scans him

0,thirties dark hair tall lean beautiful under
0,normal circumstances but at the moment shes not at her
0,best it looks like shes just come in from a hard
0,days work shes wearing an old lab coat but the
0,most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
0,we can see in her eyes
0,shes looking directly at picard for an answer picard
0,realizes he has to say something he looks into her
0,eyes and there is a moment here a brief spark of
0,chemistry that in normal circumstances the captain just
0,might follow up but at the moment he shoves that
0,electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer
0,picard
0,there was some kind of explosion
0,out at the missile silo
0,she looks at him for a moment her eyes boring into him

0,hes wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
0,carries a sidearm before the war scrimm was probably

0,oh here and there you know
0,how it is
0,
0,scrimm

0,where are you from most recently
0,picard
0,thinking fast
0,california san francisco

0,picard
0,theres a few of us left

0,again
0,scrimm
0,that was a pretty clever trick you
0,did with the hospitals batteries
0,howd you do it
0,picard
0,it wasnt a trick i used to be
0,an electrical engineer
0,scrimm
0,huh
0,he steps in front of picard again still pleasant but
0,a little bit of a smile fading from his face picard
0,realizes he isnt going to shake this man so easily
0,scrimm
0,and what were you doing out at the
0,missile silo
0,picard
0,im an old friend of cochranes

0,maybe you can tell me what hes
0,been doing in that silo we heard
0,some explosions out there this

0,you seem to have an answer for
0,everything
0,picard
0,something wrong with that

0,picard
0,thank you but ive never had

0,geordi
0,on the move
0,cochrane was going to use this

0,would depend on these old chemical
0,engines
0,beat
0,now heres the problem
0,they arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
0,a large section of the engines have been blasted away
0,leaving a deep ugly scar broken conduit lines
0,wires that now lead to nothing its clear that a key

0,geordi
0,re damage
0,this used to be the throttle valve
0,assembly
0,observing it
0,it controls the thrust of the

0,vaporized and without it
0,theres no way to launch the ship
0,picard
0,can you reconstruct the throttle
0,valve
0,geordi
0,yeah if i knew what it looked
0,like theres probably five
0,hundred ways to design a valve
0,like this
0,picard
0,we need to launch this ship in
0,under eighteen hours
0,beat
0,there must be some design
0,schematics blueprints
0,geordi
0,were tearing this place apart
0,looking for them but the

0,destroyed half the filesso
0,far nothing
0,they look at the damage in frustration
0,geordi
0,if it was just part of the warp
0,drive id know what to do but
0,this its like trying to
0,rebuild orville wrights airplane
0,with canvass and sticks
0,picard thinks remembers something
0,picard
0,wait a minute
0,int control room
0,moments later picard and geordi are looking at the

0,three clothprinted photographs seen earlier the
0,warp ship with people working on it picard spreads
0,them out on the desk
0,geordi
0,yeah i looked at these already
0,geordi points to a photo of the ship a worker is
0,walking in front of the throttle assembly blocking
0,most of it from view
0,geordi
0,you can almost see the throttle
0,assembly in this one but this
0,guy walked in front of it when
0,they took the picture
0,picard considers absently sticks his hand in his
0,jacket pocket he pulls out the canister of balm
0,scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table
0,picard
0,could you reconstruct the throttle
0,from a photograph like this if
0,that man wasnt blocking the view
0,geordi thinks it over
0,geordi
0,maybe
0,beat
0,sure yeah as long as i could
0,get a clear look at the intake
0,configuration but so far we
0,havent found any other photos

0,if there are other photographs

0,its a while later and the borg are making progress

0,on his innercircuitry the jagged voice of the woman
0,cuts in

0,i am the beginning the end i
0,am the one who is many i am the
0,borg
0,out of the mist that hugs the top of the room descends
0,the borg queen
0,she is unlike any of the borg drones weve ever seen
0,a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
0,of her body she has no legs her torso is suspended
0,by a complex rig of cables and hydraulics her face
0,and uppertorso are much more humanoid with the pasty
0,pale white of borg flesh her eyes have a silvery
0,glint to them her demeanor is seductive and sensual
0,in contrast to the harsh mechanical surroundings she
0,is an eerie blend of two worlds organic and
0,mechanical
0,with the soft hiss of hydraulics she lowers herself
0,down to where her face is very close to that of datas
0,her features are almost angelic but the silvery glint
0,in her eyes betrays an innerdarkness

0,a simple automaton
0,you have no idea how close to

0,she stares at him intently and we get the hint that
0,her interest in data may go beyond simple assimilation
0,she seems fascinated by him data picks up on this
0,data
0,how do you define perfection
0,the queen opens her arms slightly clearly indicating
0,herself
0,borg queen
0,a blending of the organic and the
0,synthetic the highest form of

0,data eyes her considering
0,data
0,an interesting definition but it
0,is not one that applies to me i
0,am completely artificial i have
0,no organic components
0,she looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
0,she mightve just found the chink in datas armor

0,have you ever wondered what its
0,like to have flesh
0,data
0,it is impossible to imagine

0,
0,she smiles
0,borg queen
0,that can change
0,the queen looks to the three borg drones and gives them
0,a silent command the drones immediately stop working
0,on datas open panels and shift their attention to
0,his right arm one of the drones tears off the sleeve
0,on datas uniform exposing his bare arm another then

0,alternate color red blue green purple orange
0,a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency
0,the phaser blasts take down a few of the borg but
0,then we see the distinctive personal forcefields of the

0,revealing that data is still strapped to the borg
0,operating table his right arm and shoulder are
0,encased in some kind of strange cybernetic shell
0,obscured from view clear tubes run out of the shell
0,into borg machinery liquid is coursing through the
0,tubes a couple of borg drones are moving about the
0,room carrying out various tasks
0,theres been a change since weve been here last
0,there are now several plexiglass cylinders surrounding
0,datas table each of them filled with some kind of
0,murky red fluid which is swirling around every once

0,we dont know what these tubes are for but theyre
0,definitely creepy
0,data takes all this in but there is nothing he can do
0,hes still immobilized
0,suddenly the table rotates and begins to move up toward

0,feel
0,data
0,i do not know what you are

0,a whoosh of hydraulic power signals another movement by
0,the borg queen she slithers through the air and down
0,slightly so that she is on the same level as data
0,she looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
0,datas right arm which opens at her silent command and
0,moves away
0,we can now see that all of the skin has been removed
0,from datas right arm showing the innerworkings of
0,his android limb circuitry and servos etc but on
0,the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
0,new a small patch of human flesh held in place with
0,various nastylooking hooks and clamps and small tubes
0,carrying blood its a delicate fragile piece of
0,organic life on an ugly mechanical surface
0,data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
0,puzzlement
0,borg queen
0,re flesh
0,do you know what this is data
0,data
0,it would appear that you are
0,attempting to graft organic skin

0,borg queen
0,what a cold description for
0,such a beautiful gift

0,ext rubys house night
0,a tiny singlestory house one or two rooms at the
0,most in serious need of repair and maintenance no
0,yard the house sits on dirt the nearest other
0,structure is at least a hundred yards away a very
0,solitary place the windows are dark painted over
0,from the inside
0,some large pieces of exoticlooking equipment are
0,sitting off the front porch
0,after a beat the front door opens letting out a soft
0,feeble light
0,ruby steps out onto the porch carrying a gallon size
0,plastic jug the light from the house now lights the
0,equipment a little giving us a better view theres
0,a contraption that appears to be a pump of some kind
0,with a funnel on top spigot at the bottom and several
0,stages of filters and tubing in between ruby sets the
0,jug underneath the spigot then sits down for a
0,moment on the edge of the porch she takes a breath
0,and runs a hand through her hair stretches her back
0,trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck an
0,exhausting day
0,picard
0,is watching her intently from afar hes concealed
0,behind a supporting beam of one the towns many
0,windmills hes in shadow hidden from rubys view
0,ruby
0,pulls off her jacket shes wearing a pullover
0,shirt and in one motion she pulls off the shirt
0,revealing only a teeshirt underneath sleeves torn off
0,long ago she stands up kicks off her boots
0,undoes her pants and begins sliding the jeans off
0,her hips
0,picard
0,is surprised glances around a little awkward this
0,really isnt why he came out here
0,ruby
0,kicks aside the jeans shes now down to teeshirt and
0,panties she grabs the bottom of the teeshirt
0,pulls it off
0,picard
0,doesnt want to look but cant help himself
0,ruby
0,moves to the side of the porch and steps into a
0,large enviromental suit a bulky onepiece with gloves
0,and helmet attached
0,picard
0,is a little relieved keeps watching
0,ruby
0,has now encased herself in the thick rubbery suit
0,pulls over a helmet with a gas mask she walks over to
0,an oil drum marked with a distinctive biohazard
0,symbol she carefully opens the lid takes a metal
0,pitcher reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
0,pitcherfull of toxic waste she closes the lid walks
0,over to the pumpfilter contraption she pours the
0,sludgelike waste into the funnelprimes the pump
0,makes a few adjustments to the filters and then
0,turns the spigot
0,after a beat a trickle of clear liquid starts to come
0,out of the spigot ruby steps back and pulls off the
0,helmet
0,picard
0,watches curious about what shes doing
0,ruby
0,is now out of the biosuit again pulling on her
0,shirt and jeans grabs her jacket turns off the
0,lights in the house and shuts the front door behind
0,her she begins walking toward the windmill
0,picard
0,steps behind the girder stays very still in the
0,shadows waits quietly as ruby passes by the windmill
0,without a glance and heads into town after shes
0,gone picard steps out from his hiding place watches
0,her go then quickly heads for rubys house
0,front porch
0,picard opens the front door and goes inside but he
0,doesnt notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
0,red light starts flashing some sort of silent alarm
0,int rubys house continuous
0,picard enters and closes the door behind him its
0,dark he fumbles around for a light switch finally
0,locates one and a soft golden glow fills the room
0,the house has only one room which functions as a
0,living room kitchen bedroom etc this is also
0,rubys darkroom the windows have been painted black
0,and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo
0,equipment all around but the most striking feature of
0,the house are the large hanging clothprinted
0,photographs they vary in size and shape some are
0,hanging on walls others hang from the ceiling in mid
0,air still others are stacked on the few pieces of
0,furniture thats here the absence of paper has forced
0,ruby to print photos on anything she can find
0,bed sheets shirts pieces of upholstery backs of
0,carpeting etc picard stands there for a moment
0,taking in the scene hes never been in anyplace
0,quite like this the cloth photos give the room a
0,feeling of a small intensely personal gallery
0,picard moves around the room looking from photo to
0,photo hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
0,silo and as he does we get our first close look at
0,rubys images and they tell us a great deal about
0,her
0,she has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
0,mundane and the ugly there are pictures of hope
0,amidst despair beauty amongst devastation there
0,seems to be a theme running through the photographs
0,a romantic almost idealistic sense of optimism
0,at one point picard finds a photograph he recognizes
0,its the rustedout hover car she photographed on the
0,streets of resurrection its an ugly decrepit piece
0,of junk but there in the center spotlighted by a
0,single ray of sunshine is a tiny flower about to
0,bloom
0,picard takes in the image for a brief moment then
0,pushes onward goes to a file of photos sitting in a
0,box begins sorting through them quickly we see
0,prewar photos printed on real paper they show a
0,younger ruby with her parents resurrection the way
0,it used to look ruby with a dog
0,picard pauses frowns gets the odd feeling that
0,someone is watching him he turns around to see
0,himself
0,a three foot photograph of picard is drying in the air
0,behind him
0,ruby mustve taken the photo when picard was on the
0,street talking to scrimm it was taken through a
0,telephoto lens a closeup of picards face he looks
0,focused determined heroic its a remarkable shot of
0,the captain and even picard is a little taken aback by
0,the image shes captured the essence of the man
0,clickclack the sound of a shotgun being cocked
0,picard freezes slowly turns around to see whos
0,there
0,rubby
0,is standing in the open doorway a shotgun leveled at
0,picard
0,ruby
0,you should pay closer attention to
0,those little red lights
0,picard glances down at the doorway sees the flashing
0,red light in the doorjamb hes busted
0,ruby
0,you know id be perfectly
0,justified in shooting you right
0,now
0,picard glances at the photograph of himself
0,picard
0,id say you already have
0,ruby
0,dont flatter yourself i take
0,pictures of a lot of junk
0,she perches herself on the arm of a small couch holds
0,the gun loosely but never taking the aim away from
0,picard
0,ruby
0,okay lets hear it im sure you
0,have a great explanation for why
0,those rocket photos are so
0,important you broke into my house

0,ruby
0,lie thats one keep going
0,picard
0,a key piece of the ship has been
0,destroyed and our only hope to
0,reconstruct it is if one of your
0,photographs shows us what it
0,looked like
0,ruby
0,considers
0,all right truth i believe that
0,one why is it so urgent you
0,couldnt wait until morning
0,picard
0,we have to launch his ship by
0,tomorrow afternoon
0,ruby
0,or
0,picard has to come up with something decides to
0,throw her off with a hightech explanation
0,picard
0,or the shielding around the
0,plutonium core will begin to
0,deteriorate within a day the
0,entire silo will become so
0,radioactive that no one will be
0,able to come near it for a hundred
0,years
0,ruby eyes him evenly
0,ruby
0,lie thats two one more and
0,i pull the trigger
0,picard is starting to get angry
0,picard
0,why are you being so difficult
0,all im asking for is to look at
0,one of the photographs itll
0,take five minutes
0,ruby
0,and all im asking for is the
0,truth that would take five
0,minutes
0,beat
0,for all i know you caused the
0,explosions at the silo and now
0,youre trying to steal zephrams
0,ship
0,picard
0,i am not a thief
0,rubys had enough her temper flares and she gets off
0,the couch takes a threatening step toward picard
0,ruby
0,no youre a petty burglar and a
0,liar
0,beat
0,youre no friend of zephrams he
0,is a great man hes not like you
0,or me or any of the other zombies
0,walking around this town
0,picard jumps in with a quiet forceful quality
0,picard
0,no hes a man with vision he
0,can see beyond the problems that
0,surround us he knows theres a
0,better future out there for
0,everyone a future where crime
0,poverty and war are things of the
0,past a future where we reach
0,out and seek our destiny in the
0,stars
0,beat
0,i believe in that future too
0,ruby i believe in it in every
0,fiber of my being and im
0,telling you if we dont launch
0,that warp ship tomorrow theres
0,a very good chance that future
0,will never happen
0,she eyes him for a moment and were not sure if his
0,words have had any effect
0,ruby still has her doubts but decides to go with her
0,gutand finally hands him the photographs picard
0,glances through them his expression tells us the
0,photo he needs is in there
0,picard
0,you wont regret this
0,they share a look and then picard turns and walks

0,worf
0,its all right do not struggle
0,worf holds the mans hand as riker shoves away a final
0,console we reveal the head and torso of doctor soran
0,one of the survivors from the lakul and last seen
0,in sickbay aboard the enterpriseb soran has not aged
0,at all over the years but he does have a permanent
0,scar on his face from the earlier wound he blinks a
0,few times seems a little dazed

0,im commander william riker of the

0,soran
0,soran doctor tolian soran
0,soran puts a hand to his head still trying to get his
0,bearings
0,riker
0,who attacked you doctor
0,soran
0,im not sure it happened so
0,fast
0,security officer
0,calls out

0,data
0,is she still angry
0,geordi
0,no but id stay out of sickbay
0,for a while if i were you i
0,still dont know why you dropped
0,her in the water
0,data
0,i was attempting to get in the
0,spirit of things i thought it
0,would be humorous
0,data frowns troubled by this recent experience he
0,puts spot down and moves to a bulkhead he activates
0,a control panel and a small compartment slides open
0,revealing a small computer chip which is suspended in
0,a glass and metal framework data looks at the chip
0,for a beat and geordi moves to him in concern
0,geordi
0,data youre not thinking about
0,using that thing are you
0,data
0,it has occurred to me on several
0,occasions but i believe this may
0,be the appropriate time
0,geordi
0,wait a minute i thought youve
0,always been afraid it would
0,overload your neural net
0,data
0,that is true however i believe
0,my growth as an artificial
0,life form has reached an impasse
0,for thirtyfour years i have
0,endeavored to become more human
0,to grow beyond my original
0,programming and yet i am still
0,unable to grasp such a simple
0,concept as humor
0,re chip
0,this emotion chip is the only
0,answer
0,geordi considers a moment looks at the chip
0,and reluctantly has to agree
0,geordi
0,all right
0,data sits down and la forge moves to stand behind him
0,geordi
0,but at the first sign of trouble
0,im going to deactivate it
0,agreed
0,data
0,agreed
0,geordi works on datas head for a moment and then
0,opens a panel on datas head revealing the blinking

0,riker is standing next to picard who has his back turned
0,and is staring out the window picard seems distracted
0,during the scene his mind clearly elsewhere as riker
0,finishes his report
0,riker
0,we found two dead romulans aboard
0,the station were analyzing
0,their equipment to see if we can
0,determine what ship they came
0,from
0,picard nods absently
0,picard
0,theres still no indication of why
0,they attacked the station
0,riker
0,we think they were looking for
0,something they practically tore
0,the place apart
0,picard
0,hmm
0,beat
0,inform starfleet command this
0,could indicate a new romulan
0,threat in this sector
0,riker
0,you want me to contact starfleet
0,picard
0,is there a problem
0,riker
0,no sir
0,picard
0,thank you number one
0,picard keeps his back turned looking out the window
0,riker hesitates awkward
0,riker
0,there is something else captain
0,one of the scientists a doctor
0,soran has insisted on speaking
0,with you
0,beat
0,i told him you were busy sir but
0,he said it was absolutely
0,imperative that he speak with you
0,right away
0,picard
0,understood that will be all
0,riker
0,sir is there anything wrong
0,picard
0,no thank you
0,a beat then riker turns and exits off picards
0,unreadable face
0,cut to
0,
0,int ten forward
0,the room is bustling with patrons and activity data
0,enters with an odd look on his facehis body
0,language subtly altered he is looking at the world
0,through new eyes geordi is following him closely
0,watching his every move they move to the bar guinan
0,comes over she has not aged at all since the
0,enterpriseb she sets down an exoticlooking container
0,full of dark liquid
0,guinan
0,you two just volunteered to be my
0,first victims
0,re liquid
0,this is a new concoction i
0,picked up on forcas three trust me
0,youre going to love it
0,she pours two glasses of the liquid data takes one
0,and sniffs it then takes a drink geordi watches him
0,closely data frowns
0,geordi
0,well
0,data
0,i believe the beverage has
0,provoked an emotional response
0,geordi
0,really what do you feel
0,data
0,i am uncertain i have had little
0,experience with emotions i am
0,unable to articulate the
0,sensation
0,guinan
0,emotions
0,geordi
0,ill explain later
0,data finishes the drink concentrates tries to make
0,sense of the rush of feelings his expression is one
0,of disgust
0,guinan
0,to geordi
0,i dont think he likes it
0,data
0,excited
0,yes that is it i hate it
0,geordi
0,data i think the chip is
0,working
0,data looks at geordi with a big smile on his face
0,data
0,yes i hate this it is
0,revolting
0,beat
0,guinan
0,another round
0,data
0,please
0,in the bg we see picard enter ten forward
0,follow picard
0,as he walks through ten forward and heads toward a
0,table by the windows soran is sitting at the table
0,staring out at the stars lost in thought his
0,observatory uniform is distinctive and sets him apart
0,from everyone else in the room picard walks up to the
0,table
0,picard
0,doctor soran
0,soran
0,yes yes captain thank you for
0,coming
0,the men shake hands and picard sits down soran is an
0,imposing physical presence but at the moment he seems
0,very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his
0,work picard waves away a waiter
0,picard
0,nothing for me
0,brusque to soran
0,i understand theres something
0,urgent you need to discuss with
0,me
0,soran
0,yes i need to return to the
0,observatory immediately i must
0,continue a critical experiment i
0,was running on the amargosa star
0,
0,picards reaction is a little impatient this doesnt
0,sound that imperative to him
0,picard
0,doctor were still conducting
0,an investigation into the attack
0,once weve completed our work
0,well be happy to allow you and
0,your fellow scientists back aboard
0,the observatory until then
0,soran
0,the timing is very important on my
0,experiment if it is not
0,completed within the next twelve
0,hours years of research will be
0,lost
0,picard
0,were doing the best we can now
0,if youll excuse me
0,picard moves to stand but soran reaches out and gently
0,but firmly grabs him by the arm the unexpected
0,physical contact and the change of intensity in sorans
0,face stops picard in his tracks
0,soran
0,cryptically
0,they say time is the fire in
0,which we burn and right now
0,captain my time is running out
0,beat
0,we leave so many things unfinished
0,in our lives im sure you can
0,understand
0,for some reason sorans words have struck a deep chord
0,within picard
0,he looks away from sorans compelling gaze and thinks
0,for a long moment when he finally speaks his voice
0,is barely above a whisper
0,
0,picard
0,ill see what i can do
0,picard walks away without a word before soran can
0,thank him soran looks after him with relief then
0,pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens it he
0,looks at the watch for a long moment then snaps it
0,closed and head for the opposite exit from the one
0,picard took follow soran across ten forwarduntil
0,he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees
0,sorans pov
0,of guinan who is now back at the bar
0,resume soran
0,a dark look crosses his face he is disturbed by the
0,sight of guinan he quickly turns and exits
0,on guinan
0,she begins to sense something as though someone is
0,watching her she turns looks in the direction where
0,soran was just standing but theres no one there now
0,she shakes off the feeling and goes back to work
0,cut to
0,int engineering
0,a short time later a romulan tricorder is connected
0,to some diagnostic equipment near a console worf is
0,talking to riker
0,worf activates a monitor which shows a complex diagram
0,of sensor information
0,worf
0,one of the dead romulans had a
0,tricorder we analyzed its sensor
0,logs and found they were scanning
0,for signature particles of a
0,compound called trilithium
0,riker
0,trilithium
0,worf
0,an experimental compound the
0,romulans have been working on in
0,theory a trilithiumbased
0,explosive would be thousands of
0,times more powerful than an
0,antimatter weapon but they never
0,found a way to stabilize it
0,
0,riker
0,why were they looking for it on a
0,federation observatory it doesnt
0,make any sense
0,riker considers
0,riker
0,contd
0,have geordi and data go over with
0,the next away team tell them to
0,scan the observatory for
0,trilithium
0,worf
0,aye sir
0,cut to
0,int observatory ops
0,the station is still a wreck geordi and data are
0,scanning the room with tricorders
0,geordi
0,off tricorder
0,theres no sign of any trilithium
0,in here
0,geordi continues to scan then suddenly data lets out
0,a quiet giggle geordi stops and turns to look at him
0,data giggles louder
0,data
0,laughing to himself
0,i get it i get it
0,geordi
0,you get what
0,data laughs again
0,data
0,when you said to commander
0,riker
0,imitating geordis voice
0,the clown can stay but the
0,ferengi in the gorilla suit has to
0,go
0,geordi looks blankly at him for a moment
0,geordi
0,what
0,data
0,during the farpoint mission we
0,were on the bridge and you told a
0,joke that was the punch line
0,geordi
0,the farpoint mission data that
0,was seven years ago
0,data
0,i know i just got it
0,laughs
0,it was very funny
0,geordi
0,thanks
0,geordi indicates a corridor they exit in that
0,direction
0,int observatory corridor continuous
0,a short corridor connecting the ops center with other
0,compartments geordi suddenly stops in front of what
0,appears to be a standard bulkhead
0,geordi
0,wait a minute theres a hidden
0,doorway here i can see the
0,joint of the metal with my visor
0,geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what
0,appears to be a smooth bulkhead
0,data
0,off tricorder
0,there appears to be a dampening
0,field in operation i cannot scan
0,beyond the bulkhead

0,geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace they exit
0,to
0,int observatory probe room continuous
0,a small room with several probes stacked in holding
0,racks geordi and data scan
0,geordi
0,im still not picking up anything
0,someone went to a lot of trouble
0,to shield this room
0,they put their tricorders away and begin looking around
0,the room data continues to snicker and giggle as he
0,tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up
0,geordi begins inspecting the probes finally stops
0,at one probe which has several odd devices attached to
0,the side
0,geordi
0,data take a look at this
0,data comes over
0,you ever seen a solar probe with

0,data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he
0,opens and closes it like a mouth
0,data
0,making tricorder talk
0,no geordi i have not it is
0,most unusual
0,
0,data giggles and geordi reacts with the irritation of
0,someone listening to a very bad comedian
0,
0,geordi
0,just help me get this panel open
0,data helps geordi as they try to open a panel on the
0,casing of the probe they open the panel and geordi
0,looks insidehe reacts to something
0,geordi
0,whoa my visors picking up
0,something in the theta bandit

0,begins to jerk and shake and goes into a bizarre
0,emotional seizure a rush of emotions race across

0,geordi
0,data
0,geordi rushes to him data has a look of surprise on

0,data are you all right

0,soran
0,id be happy to
0,soran moves toward them and then without warning he

0,actually im here to see if
0,theres anything i can do for you
0,picard
0,well i appreciate your concern

0,right now thank you
0,
0,but troi wont be brushed away so easily
0,troi
0,im afraid i cant just leave it
0,at that the commanding officer
0,of this ship is clearly distraught
0,about something as ships
0,counselor its my duty to

0,you cant fool an empath captain
0,i know exactly when im needed
0,picard is really not in the mood for this his tone
0,hardens
0,picard
0,well with all due respect to your
0,betazoid senses i prefer to be

0,beat
0,admiral lusby regarding the

0,picard i find him increasingly

0,what i cant get out of my mind is
0,the image of rene my nephew
0,i just cant believe hes gone
0,he trails off
0,troi
0,its only natural to feel a
0,heightened sense of tragedy when
0,a child dies
0,sensing more
0,but it goes deeper than that
0,doesnt it i can sense that rene
0,meant a great deal to you
0,picard
0,in a way he was as close as i
0,ever came to having a child of my
0,own
0,troi eyes an open photo album on the table she reaches

0,troi
0,your family history is very
0,important to you isnt it
0,picard
0,nods
0,ever since i was a little boy i
0,remember hearing about the family

0,settled the first martian colony
0,when my brother married and had a
0,son
0,picard hesitates this is difficult for him
0,troi
0,you felt it was no longer your

0,you know counselor im not
0,getting any younger for some
0,time now ive been aware that
0,there are fewer days ahead than
0,there are behind
0,beat
0,but i always took comfort in the
0,fact that when i was gone my
0,family would continue but now
0,picard moves back to the photo album open it to the
0,last page an then flips through the remaining pages
0,they are blank
0,picard
0,ive had brushes with death
0,more than i care to contemplate

0,picard
0,do you remember him
0,guinan
0,oh yes i remember everyone who
0,was on the lakul every face
0,even the ones who didnt make
0,it
0,guinan stands and begins to move about the room
0,shes clearly troubled by the memories she hesitates
0,looks off into the middledistance for a few moments
0,picard moves to her
0,picard
0,guinan its important that you
0,tell me what you know we think
0,sorans developed a weapon a
0,terrible weapon it might give
0,him enough power to
0,guinan
0,soran doesnt care about power or
0,weapons all he cares about is
0,getting back to the nexus
0,picard
0,whats the nexus
0,guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some
0,exoticlooking alien artifacts distracting
0,herself this is difficult for her to discuss
0,guinan
0,its a place ive tried very hard
0,to forget
0,she makes the decision to plunge ahead
0,guinan
0,that ribbon isnt just some random
0,energy phenomenon traveling
0,through space its a doorway
0,it leads to another place the
0,nexus it doesnt exist in our
0,universe and it doesnt play by
0,the same rules either
0,picard
0,what happened to you
0,guinan
0,i cant remember very much what
0,it looked like or how long i was
0,there but i do remember how it
0,felt
0,she turns to him and her face is filled with some kind
0,of awe at the memory
0,guinan
0,it was like being inside joy
0,as if joy was a real thing that i
0,could wrap around myself ive
0,never been so content
0,a long beat as picard absorbs her words
0,picard
0,but then you were beamed away
0,guinan shows a rare burst of anger
0,guinan
0,i was pulled away i didnt want
0,to leave none of us did i felt
0,like id left a part of myself
0,behind all i could think about
0,was getting back i didnt care
0,what i had to do
0,guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars
0,guinan
0,it took a long time but
0,eventually i learned to live with
0,it and i began to realize that
0,my experience in the nexus had
0,changed me
0,beat
0,i knew things about people
0,about eventsabout time
0,picard
0,your sixth sense ive always
0,wondered where it came from
0,beat
0,and what about soran
0,guinan
0,soran may still be obsessed with
0,getting back and if he is hell
0,do anything to find that doorway
0,again
0,picard
0,but why destroy a star
0,beat
0,thank you guinan
0,he heads for the door
0,guinan
0,let someone else do it jeanluc
0,picard stops looks at her
0,guinan
0,let them send another starship
0,dont get near the ribbon if you
0,go into that nexus youre not
0,going to care about soran or the
0,enterprise or me all youre
0,going to care about is how it
0,feels to be there
0,beat
0,and youre never going to come
0,back
0,picard weighs her words sees the warning in her
0,eyes and carefully backs away and exits
0,cut to
0,int klingon bird of prey quarters vfxp
0,a dimlylit room somewhere in the bowels of the klingon
0,ship like every other room on this decrepit ship the

0,seated behind a table holding the visor a padd and
0,sorans pocket watch sit on the table geordi is
0,sitting in a chair across from him his shirt has
0,been removed he looks very tense
0,
0,soran
0,re visor
0,a remarkable piece of equipment
0,but a little inelegant wouldnt
0,you say
0,beat
0,have you ever considered a
0,prosthesis that would make you
0,look a little more normal
0,geordi
0,whats normal
0,soran
0,normal is what everyone else is
0,and what you are not
0,geordi
0,what do you want
0,soran takes a moment
0,soran
0,as you may or may not be aware i
0,am an elaurian some people call
0,us a race of listeners we
0,listen
0,beat
0,right now mr la forge you
0,have my undivided attention i
0,want to listen to everything you
0,know about trilithium and me
0,geordi thinks
0,geordi
0,trilithium is an experimental
0,compound developed by the
0,romulans i think its a
0,derivative of
0,soran picks up the padd from the desk and activates it
0,suddenly something small with sharp edges can be
0,seen moving just underneath geordis skin near his
0,chest geordi moves his hand to the spot but then the
0,protrusion is suddenly gone
0,soran
0,i dont want a science lecture
0,you were on that observatory
0,looking for trilithium why
0,geordi
0,i was ordered to by the captain
0,on the padd in sorans hand we can now see an interior
0,graphic of geordis body sitting in the chair the
0,graphic is interactive moving as geordi moves
0,a blinking dot represents the movement of the probe
0,inside his body right now the dot is in the middle
0,of his chest
0,soran
0,lets try to move beyond the usual
0,prisonerinterrogator banter
0,shall we you have information
0,and i need it
0,beat
0,did the captain explain his orders
0,to you did he say why you were
0,searching for trilithium
0,geordi
0,no
0,soran
0,what about guinan what has
0,she told you about me
0,geordi
0,guinan i dont know what youre
0,talking about
0,on the padd we now see the dot has moved to a position
0,next to geordis heart soran looks up at geordi
0,soran
0,my instincts tell me youre lying
0,and i know that cant be easy for
0,you
0,off padd
0,i can see you have a good heart
0,soran taps a control on the padd suddenly geordi
0,grabs his chest in pain soran watches geordi for a
0,few seconds then taps the padd again geordi gasps
0,and starts to breathe
0,soran
0,oh i forgot to tell you while
0,you were unconscious i injected
0,a nanoprobe into your
0,bloodstream its been navigating
0,your cardiovascular system and
0,right now ive attached it to your
0,left ventricle
0,smiles
0,a little trick i picked up
0,from the borg
0,geordi
0,gasping
0,yeah theyre full of great
0,ideas
0,soran
0,i just stopped your heart for five
0,seconds it felt like an
0,eternity didnt it did you know
0,that you can stop the human heart
0,for up to ten minutes before the
0,onset of brain damage
0,geordi
0,no i didnt know that
0,soran
0,we learn something new about
0,ourselves every day
0,beat
0,now maybe i didnt make myself
0,clear it is very important that
0,you tell me exactly what captain
0,picard knows
0,geordi
0,i told you everything you might
0,as well just kill me right now
0,sorans features soften as he smiles slightly for a
0,moment he looks genuinely compassionate and its
0,a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity
0,soran
0,im not a killer mr la forge
0,beat
0,lets try thirty seconds
0,soran taps a control on the padd geordi gasps and
0,strains against an unimaginable pain

0,i wanted to save geordi i

0,fear is a very difficult emotion

0,i let it prevent me from helping
0,my friend
0,beat
0,does that make me a coward

0,his fantasy he is more interested in the sights and
0,sounds around him a dog barks from oc they both
0,look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
0,kirk with enthusiasm
0,kirk
0,affectionately
0,jake jake you miserable old
0,mutt how can you be here
0,to picard
0,hes been dead seven years
0,kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we
0,hear a womans voice from somewhere upstairs that
0,stops kirk in his tracks as she speaks we can see
0,the shock on kirks face
0,antonias voice
0,come on jim im starving how
0,long are you going to be rattling
0,around that kitchen
0,a beat
0,kirk
0,amazed
0,thats antonia
0,kirk looks at the food on the stove hes beginning to
0,realize something
0,kirk
0,wait a minute
0,kirk glances at picard
0,kirk
0,the future what are you
0,talking about this is the
0,past
0,kirk moves to a drawer and opens it inside is a
0,horseshoe with a tiny red bow tied to it this
0,confirms things for kirk he picks up the horseshoe
0,kirk
0,this is nine years ago the day
0,i told her i was going back to
0,starfleet
0,kirk is swept up in the moment overwhelmed by
0,memories sensations feelings he goes back to the
0,frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden
0,burst of recognition
0,kirk
0,these were ktarian eggs her
0,favoritei was cooking them to
0,soften the blow
0,re horseshoe
0,and i gave her this
0,picard steps in
0,picard
0,i know how real this must seem to
0,you but its not this isnt
0,really your house weve both
0,been caught up in some sort of
0,temporal nexus
0,but kirks mind is clearly elsewhere hes being
0,swept away by the emotion of the moment realizing the
0,opportunity he suddenly has
0,kirk
0,dill weed
0,kirk indicates a shelf as if asking picard to go to
0,it
0,kirk
0,theres a bottle of dill weed on
0,the second shelf to the left
0,right behind the nutmeg
0,kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs
0,he cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins
0,preparing a breakfast picard waits for a moment then
0,goes to the shelf grabs the dill weed and hands it
0,to kirk
0,picard
0,how long have you been here
0,kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs
0,kirk
0,i dont know i was on the
0,enterpriseb in the deflector
0,control room keep stirring
0,these will you
0,kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a
0,breakfast tray picard is getting a little impatient
0,but stirs the eggs anyway
0,kirk
0,continuing
0,the bulkhead in front of me
0,disappeared then i was out
0,there chopping wood
0,back to stove
0,thanks
0,kirk takes the pan of eggs back from picard
0,picard
0,history records that you died
0,saving the enterpriseb from an
0,energy ribbon eighty years ago
0,but picards words mean almost nothing to kirk he is
0,thoroughly enjoying himself and picard is almost a
0,distraction kirk begins serving the eggs onto the
0,plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
0,tray
0,kirk
0,amused
0,so youre telling me this is the
0,twentyfourth century and im
0,dead
0,
0,picard
0,not exactly as i said this is
0,some kind of
0,kirk
0,temporal nexus yeah i heard you
0,frowns at tray
0,somethings missing
0,then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster
0,as if on cue two slices of toast pop out kirk grins
0,and puts the toast on the plates kirk picks up the
0,tray and heads for the door
0,picard
0,captain i need your help i want
0,you to leave the nexus with me
0,kirk goes out of the kitchen and picard follows
0,int kirks home living room day continuous
0,kirk and picard both on the move kirk heading for a
0,staircase
0,picard
0,we have to go back to a planet
0,called veridian iii and stop a
0,man from destroying a star there
0,are millions of lives at stake
0,kirk tries to keep it light hoping this man will go
0,away
0,kirk
0,you said history considers me
0,dead who am i to argue with
0,history
0,picard
0,youre a starfleet officer and you
0,have a duty to
0,kirk
0,hard
0,i dont need to be lectured by
0,you i was out saving the galaxy
0,when your grandfather was still in
0,diapers and frankly i think the
0,galaxy owes me one
0,beat
0,i was like you once so worried
0,about duty and obligations that i
0,couldnt see anything past this
0,uniform and in the end what did
0,it get me nothing not this
0,time
0,kirk brushes past picard and stops at the foot of the
0,stairs
0,kirk
0,looking up the stairs
0,im going to walk up these stairs
0,march into that bedroom and tell
0,antonia that i want to marry her
0,kirk begins to climb the stairs
0,kirk
0,this time things are going to be
0,different
0,he goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind
0,him picard glances around the room in frustration
0,then gets a determined look on his face and marches up
0,the stairs after kirk grasps the doorknob opens it
0,and steps through the door into
0,int barn day continuous
0,picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
0,of a wooden barn straw on the floor farm
0,implements on the walls sunlight streaming in
0,through the slats there are stalls in the barn with
0,a few horses visible
0,kirk is standing a short distance away he looks
0,surprised as well and he is no longer holding the
0,tray of food
0,picard
0,re barn
0,this doesnt look like your
0,bedroom
0,kirk looks around for a moment the pieces starting to
0,fall into place he smiles with a growing
0,realization
0,kirk
0,no no its not its better
0,picard
0,better
0,kirk
0,this is my uncles barn in iowa
0,he points to a horse with a saddle on it
0,kirk
0,re horse
0,i took that horse out for a ride
0,seven years ago on a spring
0,day
0,kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a
0,beautiful spring day
0,
0,kirk
0,just like this if im right
0,this is the day i met antonia
0,he turns to picard
0,kirk
0,this nexus of yours is very
0,clever i can start all over
0,again do things right from day
0,one
0,kirk grabs the horse swings up onto the saddle and
0,rides out of the barn filled with excitement picard
0,watches him for a moment then looks at one of the
0,other horses in the barn he makes a decision and
0,then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall
0,
0,cut to
0,ext countryside day vfxp
0,kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside
0,and across a stream through a thicket of trees and
0,finally out onto a rolling plain there is a large
0,ravine up ahead kirk sees it and smiles tightly he
0,spurs his horse faster toward the ravine the horse
0,is tearing along comes up to the edge of the
0,precipice and makes a daring leap to the other side
0,
0,horse and rider land together and kirk spurs the horse
0,on but as he rides we begin to see a change come
0,over him a look of doubt crosses his face
0,somethings not right he slows the horse to a trot
0,and then to a complete stop he sits there for a
0,moment and frowns turns and looks back at the
0,ravine which is now a fair distance away something
0,about that jump is nagging at him
0,he turns his horse around and then digs in his heels
0,the horse breaks into a gallop racing back toward the
0,ravine
0,kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the
0,horse makes the leap across yet again
0,this time when kirk lands he brings his horse to an
0,immediate stop we can see on his face that something
0,is very wrong he turns and stares at the ravine with
0,a mixture of shock and sadness on his face
0,in the distance picard can be seen approaching on a
0,horse of his own he stops next to kirk there is a
0,long quiet moment as the two men sit there side by
0,side kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
0,feelings
0,kirk
0,re ravine
0,i must have made this jump fifty
0,times and every time it scared
0,the hell out of me but not this
0,time
0,beat
0,because its not real
0,a quiet beat kirk turns and looks toward a particular
0,hill in the distance shading his eyes against the
0,bright sun picard follows his gaze and we can now see
0,the distant figure of a woman walking her horse
0,
0,picard
0,re woman
0,antonia
0,kirk
0,nods
0,shes not real either is she
0,nothing here is nothing here
0,matters
0,all euphoria is now gone from kirk its a moment of
0,selfrevelation he glances around
0,kirk
0,its kinda like orbital
0,skydiving exciting for a few
0,minutes but in the end you
0,havent really done anything
0,you havent made a difference
0,kirk takes a beat then looks at picard and in a way
0,hes truly seeing him for the first time
0,kirk
0,captain of the enterprise huh
0,picard
0,thats right
0,kirk
0,close to retirement
0,picard
0,i hadnt planned on it
0,there is a passion and a fervor in kirk that we havent
0,seen until now
0,kirk
0,well let me tell you something
0,dont dont let them promote
0,you dont let them transfer
0,you dont let anything take you
0,off the bridge of that ship
0,beat
0,because while youre there you
0,can make a difference
0,the two captains face each other for a moment picard
0,hears what kirk is saying but also knows thats not the
0,whole story picard gives him a direct look and there
0,is something in picards eyes a glint of resolve and
0,determination
0,picard
0,you dont need to be on the bridge
0,of a starship come with me
0,help me stop soran
0,beat
0,make a difference again
0,a long silent beat as kirk considers picard and slowly
0,unexpectedly a smile spreads across his face
0,kirk
0,how can i argue with the captain
0,of the enterprise
0,a beat
0,what was the name of that
0,planet veridian iii
0,picard
0,thats right
0,kirk
0,i take it the odds are against us
0,and the situation is grim
0,picard
0,you could say that
0,kirk
0,musing
0,of course if spock were here
0,hed say i was being an
0,irrational illogical human for
0,wanting to go on a mission like
0,that
0,and for the first time we can see the twinkle in his
0,eye that tells us jim kirk is back
0,kirk
0,sounds like fun
0,the two men turn and walk away from antoniaand as
0,they walk a roar of color and sound washes out the
0,screen as seen before

0,geordi
0,hed have all your memories
0,too you feel comfortable with
0,that
0,data
0,i feel nothing geordi it is

0,an individual more like you
0,you mean

0,just dont know if his matrix
0,will be able to adapt or if
0,hell be able to retain any
0,thing we should give him
0,some time
0,data has been studying some circuitry in the bs

0,data
0,what purpose does this serve
0,geordi
0,also examining

0,overload
0,data
0,dr soong must have found it
0,unnecessary in later versions
0,geordi

0,keep him here and run some

0,the crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light

0,was reman they re surprised by this realization
0,shinzon just stares at picard through the darkness
0,for a moment
0,shinzon
0,captain picard jean luc
0,picard i dont mean to
0,stare its just well you
0,cant imagine how long ive

0,to data
0,you may scan me without

0,all of this i knew but i
0,didnt know you were so
0,beautiful
0,riker
0,you seem very familiar with

0,shinzon moves even closer to deanna not taking his
0,eyes from her
0,shinzon
0,i am commander riker
0,to deanna
0,may i touch your hair
0,picard
0,firm
0,praetor weve come to romulus
0,on a matter we were assured
0,was of great importance if
0,you have anything to say to
0,us as representatives of the
0,federation i suggest you do
0,so now
0,shinzon continues to stare at deanna it is
0,strangely seductive almost disquieting in its
0,intensity deanna handles it with grace her level
0,gaze never leaving his
0,shinzon
0,softly
0,on the world i come from
0,theres no light no sun
0,beauty isnt important i see
0,now theres a world elsewhere
0,picard
0,praetor shinzon we re not
0,here to discuss your lack of
0,a social life
0,shinzon
0,turning back to
0,picard
0,yes im sorry captain
0,smiling
0,theres so much we have to
0,talk about
0,picard
0,i would be interested to know
0,what we are talking about
0,shinzon
0,unity captain tearing down
0,the walls between us to
0,recognize we are one people
0,federation and romulan human
0,and vulcan and klingon and
0,reman im speaking of the
0,thing that makes us the same
0,we want peace
0,picard and the others are stunned
0,shinzon
0,i want to end the centuries
0,of mistrust i want to be your
0,ally not your enemy as a
0,first step i propose we
0,eliminate the neutral zone
0,and begin a free and open
0,exchange of goods and ideas
0,picard
0,and the senate supports you
0,shinzon
0,dry
0,i have dissolved the senate
0,a beat
0,shinzon
0,right now you re thinking
0,this all sounds too good to
0,be true
0,picard
0,yes
0,shinzon
0,and youre wondering why the
0,scimitar is so well armed is
0,this the ship of a peacemaker
0,or a predator
0,picard is startled at shinzons choice of words
0,shinzon
0,contd
0,but youre also thinking the
0,chance for peace is too
0,promising to ignore above
0,allyoure trying to decide if
0,you can trust me
0,picard
0,yes
0,shinzon
0,then perhaps the time has
0,come to add some illumination
0,to our discussion computer
0,raise lighting four levels
0,lights shoot up around the room
0,for the first time the crew can see shinzon
0,clearly picard actually gasps when he sees
0,shinzons face the rest of the crew doesnt
0,understand his reaction
0,shinzon
0,allow me to tell you a story
0,that i hope will clarify my
0,position when i was very
0,young i was stricken with an
0,odd disease i developed a
0,hypersensitivity to sound
0,the slightest whisper caused
0,me agony
0,picard watches him carefully wary and strangely
0,intense
0,shinzon
0,no one knew what to do
0,finally i was taken to a
0,doctor who had some experience
0,with terran illnesses and i
0,was finally diagnosed with
0,shalafts syndrome do you
0,know of it captain
0,picard
0,you know i do
0,the crew is dumbfounded at picards unusual
0,reaction
0,shinzon
0,then you know its a very
0,rare syndrome genetic all
0,the male members of my family
0,had it eventually i was
0,treated now i can hear as
0,well as you can captain
0,he steps toward picard who holds his ground
0,shinzon
0,i can see as well as you can
0,i can feel everything you
0,feel
0,he stops right before picard
0,shinzon
0,contd
0,in fact i feel exactly what
0,you feel dont i jean luc
0,picard stares at him with a mixture of realization
0,and curiosity it is as if picard is looking into
0,a strange remembered mirror shinzons face is
0,nearly identical to his at that age
0,shinzon
0,do you trust me now
0,a beat
0,picard
0,we need to talk just you and
0,i
0,shinzon
0,come to dinner on romulus
0,tomorrow just the two of us
0,or just the one of us
0,picard
0,you know i need to verify
0,this
0,shinzon
0,i know
0,the crew is utterly confused their confusion turns
0,to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a
0,reman knife and cuts his arm drawing a little
0,blood he hands the knife to data
0,shinzon
0,tomorrow then captain we

0,picard
0,what happened
0,shinzon
0,as happens so frequently here
0,on romulus a new government

0,he cant find
0,the words
0,i was a slave and a monster
0,the only thing the romulan
0,guards hated more than the
0,remans was me but one man
0,took pity on me the man who
0,became my viceroy he taught
0,me how to survive and in
0,that dark place where there

0,geordi
0,which is why our initial scans
0,didnt pick it up but hes
0,got it captain
0,picard
0,as i remember thalaron
0,research was banned in the
0,federation because of its
0,bioqenic properties
0,beverly
0,it has the ability to consume
0,organic material at the

0,overestimate the danger of

0,a microscopic amount could
0,kill every living thing on
0,this ship in a matter of
0,seconds
0,picard
0,understood keep on it i
0,need to know what he has and

0,why am i here
0,shinzon
0,i was lonely
0,shinzon realizes picard is staring at the veins on

0,shinzon
0,contd
0,perhaps im not aging as well
0,as you did

0,picard glances to the b
0,shinzon
0,yes the bait you couldnt
0,refuse i learned there might
0,be an existing prototype from
0,a cardassian historian then
0,went to a great deal of
0,trouble to find it and
0,scatter it about on kolarus
0,iii i knew it would pique
0,your curiosity and conven
0,iently make the enterprise
0,the closest ship to romulus
0,when i contacted starfleet
0,the reman doctor leaves the cell the force field is
0,reactivated the doctor goes to the mysterious
0,medical apparatus and analyzes picards blood as
0,picard
0,all of this so you could
0,capture me
0,shinzon
0,dont be so vain after we
0,found it we made a few
0,modifications an extra memory
0,port a hidden transponder
0,perhaps your eyes will be a
0,bit less confident when you
0,learn ive gained access to

0,the enterprise maybe even
0,that and when this mission is

0,kirk and spock another swarm approaching o
0,this sensor swarm has been coming from a direction

0,close on kirk and spock against tube wall
0,spock opens his hand retaining a hold on something
0,with his fingers he brings it up to kirks face mask
0,its a tiny sensor its multicolors flashing as it
0,tries to escape from spocks fingers and in this close
0,view we see that this is a sensor very much like the
0,one weve seen earlier embedded in the iliaprobes
0,throat hollow then spock releases it and it darts
0,to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
0,wall

0,balls extending into the distance to one side the
0,gleaming crystal memory wall
0,b kirk and spock b
0,as spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what

0,again propels himself toward the memory crystals
0,kirk follows
0,c at memory crystal c
0,as spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings

0,taneously the rocking ceases at the same time ilia
0,is saying
0,ilia
0,it is illogical to withhold

0,kirk does not reply to this turns away to observe
0,the withdrawing crew most are out only spock
0,decker and mccoy remain behind with mccoy on his

0,ilia
0,they have repressed the creator

0,ment the very tone of her voice is enough for them
0,to realize they have made a very telling point kirk
0,follows fast
0,kirk
0,then vger must withdraw its

0,but spock is ready with an answer
0,spock
0,captain the vessel vger
0,obviously operates from a

0,spock allows the sentence to hang as he and kirk
0,eye each other significantly the camera swinging
0,over to kirk so we can perceive that to kirk this
0,idea has an even greater significance
0,kirk
0,to spock
0,the orbiting devices would be
0,controlled from the point
0,then
0,spock
0,precisely
0,kirk nods grimly faces ilia again this time
0,hes playing for all the stakes
0,kirk
0,the carbon units information
0,cannot be disclosed to vgers
0,probe only to vger directly

0,well mr decker it seems my

0,mr chekov when do those devices

0,ext enterprise int vger
0,the ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
0,more active than anything we have previously seen

0,seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
0,it at all the entire chamber pulses with machine
0,like alien life this should even be evidenced in the

0,spock
0,vger has begun to understand the

0,alt we have twentyone minutes captain
0,we can still save vger and ourselves
0,all this has caused kirk to vacillate but he still
0,believes his course of action is the proper one as
0,ilia
0,the carbon units will now provide
0,vger the required information
0,ilia is moving toward the elevator turning to face
0,the others as she says this kirk remains frozen his
0,hand on the intercom button he glances at mccoy as
0,though seeking advice mccoy peers at him blandly
0,levelly kirk must follow his own instinct
0,favoring kirk
0,gazing at ilia then at spock his brain racing con
0,sidering all the possibilities options he glances
0,at the anxious faces awaiting his decision a possible
0,twentytwo more minutes of life or instant death
0,another beat as he decides then
0,kirk
0,into intercom
0,mr scott were holding off
0,there may be a chance

0,spock and mccoy
0,spock bones
0,he starts for elevator

0,as kirk strides toward the elevator joining mccoy and
0,spock
0,kirk
0,mr decker i will contact you
0,every five minutes otherwise
0,inform mr scott immediately
0,decker
0,calls after him
0,captain id like to go along
0,kirk studies decker a beat there is something com
0,pelling about deckers manner a certain sense of
0,absolute necessity kirk seems about to deny the re
0,quest then turns to sulu
0,kirk
0,mr sulu you have the conn
0,and kirk leaves decker his face reflecting a strange
0,almost eager gratification hurries after him
0,kirk
0,vger plans to literally meld
0,to reduce both itself and the
0,creator to patterns
0,spock
0,and then to reassemble itself
0,combined with the creator the
0,most certain way of obtaining
0,all the creators answers
0,a sudden storm of light and strange sound in the
0,midst of it kirk finds a shaft of light very much
0,centering on him he sees ilia watching him with
0,none of their former navigator in her expression
0,now kirk hesitates gathering his thoughts
0,kirk
0,to ilia
0,our data is being prepared
0,
0,ilia
0,answer
0,kirk
0,we will answer and present proof
0,of our answer when it is ready
0,kirks words lead to a suggestion of frustration in the
0,storm of light and sound around them
0,kirk
0,continuing
0,vger we will bring the creator
0,to you here
0,angle emphasizing ilia and decker
0,as he moves to her
0,decker
0,we need only a few more minutes
0,believe me
0,decker has reached out to touch her the probe spins
0,at his touch the move knocks decker from his feet
0,tumbling a hard fall then the robe looks at him
0,lying there just the slightest softening of her
0,features now
0,emphasizing decker
0,slowly turning to face the probe again
0,decker
0,ilia believe me the creator
0,will appear
0,emphasizing ilia
0,as she meets deckers look her expression softening
0,still more the storm of light and sound begins to

0,chekovs intercom voice
0,we are now checking with starfleet
0,archives captain stand by
0,angle on decker and ilia
0,kirk spock and mccoy are standing some distance from
0,them out of hearing the probe is clearly moving
0,into still closer touch with lt ilias memory patterns
0,as decker takes her hand
0,decker
0,and when vger melds what will
0,happen to you
0,ilia
0,it will take me from you
0,kirk spock and mccoy
0,mccoy is looking at kirk with an incredulous expression
0,on his face
0,mccoy
0,and when it realizes what the
0,creator is
0,kirk
0,theres no way to know vger
0,expected it to be a machine
0,some single entity
0,indicates entire
0,site
0,all of us here may be reduced
0,into patterns
0,spock
0,that seems to be what it has
0,planned to have the creator
0,physically present here
0,mccoy
0,small smile
0,the god it captures is going to
0,be a hell of a disappointment
0,decker and ilia
0,at the side of voyager six decker in the midst of
0,twisting a wingnut which releases a hatch which swings
0,open decker peers inside while ilia waits
0,kirk spock and mccoy
0,decker and ilia at the old capsule in bg as kirk
0,looks that way
0,kirk
0,commander
0,we see decker look up at kirks call then ignore him
0,and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch at
0,this moment from kirks communicator a signal
0,kirk
0,continuing
0,into communicator
0,kirk here
0,uhuras intercom voice
0,we now have the response code

0,kirk
0,stand by transmit it on my

0,kirk
0,continuing
0,enterprise transmit
0,decker and ilia
0,catching decker in the midst of pressing a control on
0,his tricorder both he and ilia are watching kirk
0,and the others closely now decker looks down at the

0,decker
0,recording
0,kirk spock and mccoy
0,still waiting they continue to wait mccoy shifts
0,uncomfortably throws kirk a puzzled glance kirk
0,finally lifts his communicator
0,kirk
0,enterprise are you transmitting
0,uhuras intercom voice
0,affirmative captain for some
0,time now
0,kirk
0,confirm code and transmitting

0,chekovs intercom voice
0,both signal and frequency
0,confirmed sir
0,decker
0,calling
0,captain kirk
0,various angles
0,as the others turn to decker and ilia
0,decker
0,continuing
0,the fault is here sir not in
0,the transmission
0,indicating into
0,hatch
0,the antenna leads have been
0,disconnected vger never
0,intended to accept a transmitted
0,signal
0,kirk
0,capture god in order to
0,retrieve vgers data the
0,creator has to physically come
0,here
0,decker
0,and plug the signal directly into
0,the circuitry at this
0,indicates into
0,access
0,point here captain it
0,should pick up even a tricorder
0,playback
0,kirk
0,lifting communicator
0,enterprise i want that signal
0,again transmit
0,then kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
0,as decker did earlier then he looks up reacts as
0,he sees decker holding his own tricorder up and a
0,smile playing on deckers face
0,action angle
0,as kirk suddenly pivots races toward decker but he
0,passes too close to the iliaprobe it sends him
0,spinning back tumbling to his knees
0,at kirk
0,as kirk starts up to scramble to his feet but spock has
0,stepped in putting a hand on kirks shoulder and re
0,straining him
0,spock
0,jim he wants it
0,decker
0,you got the enterprise its
0,what you wanted this is what
0,i want
0,smiles
0,but jim
0,now very seriously
0,im the right choice for this
0,mission
0,and then decker shoves the tricorder into the access
0,hatch
0,various effects shots decker being fused vger
0,transcending s
0,for just an instant nothing happens and then a
0,blinding shaft of light strikes decker the color
0,becomes brighter and brighter begins spiraling through
0,the room ilia stes toward decker is caught in the
0,light and instantly vanishes in a brilliant white glow
0,we see decker seeming to grow larger as if his
0,molecular pattern is expanding a spectacular series
0,of visuals the spiraling light enveloping the entire
0,area
0,all this emanating from deckers body becoming larger
0,also brighter and brighter until now it is almost
0,transparent and the spiraling now expanding in all
0,directions and the room itself starting to dissolve
0,vanishing into nothingness and all commencing to
0,slip into the new dimension
0,kirk spock and mccoy stand transfixed another instant
0,around them vger seems to be transforming into bril
0,liant lovely patterns they all turn and race into
0,the complex in the direction of their vessel
0,ext earth orbit an energy bolt s
0,it too seems to be flowering into loveliness brilliant
0,graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
0,dimension vanishing
0,ext vger full shot
0,
0,the flowering effect now spreading outward vgers
0,massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting
0,graceful shapes and brilliant colors a transcendence
0,into another dimension
0,and then all of that is left is a shimmering jewellike
0,point of light and then it too fades and reveals
0,there in the blueblack of space the uss enterprise
0,int bridge including the viewer o
0,which shows now only space and its familiar star
0,patterns all gaze at the viewer awed at what theyve
0,seen and undergone they exchange looks silently no
0,one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some
0,thing which is beyond mere words we hear an elevator
0,door scott and chapel enter the bridge and stand
0,silently watching
0,mccoy
0,well it certainly has been
0,interesting
0,kirk
0,spock we were its answer
0,spock
0,nods
0,yes captain it needed our
0,mortality the fear of it our
0,struggle against it our fears
0,our dreams
0,kirk
0,and the foolish emotions
0,which drive us
0,spock
0,looks at kirk then
0,i prefer your poet dantes phrase

0,david
0,well theres your life form
0,reading these were microbes on
0,the tubes surface we shot them
0,here from enterprise
0,with irony
0,they were fruitful and

0,saavik
0,but how could they have evolved
0,so quickly
0,david doesnt answer his curiosity caught by something

0,continuing
0,what is it
0,saavik
0,spocks burial robe
0,as they stare at each other without answers the planet
0,makes a gentle rumbling sound then the ground qui
0,vers slightly
0,and in the far distance a poignant cry is heard a
0,young animal in pain perhaps saavik and david do not
0,know
0,cut to
0,int kirks apartment view of the bay night
0,tranquil we hear the sounds of harbor and distant

0,they all turn toward the door we hear it whirr open
0,os their expressions change and they stare at
0,their pov angle toward the door
0,a tall mysterious figure in a hooded vulcan robe walks
0,slowly toward us then stops close face unseen is
0,it bones a spock apparition the figure removes
0,his hood revealing the distinguished older features
0,of

0,ambassador sarek comes to kirk
0,kirk
0,continuing
0,ambassador i i had no idea you
0,were here
0,then
0,i think you know my crew

0,excuse us please
0,the crew their concern showing leave their glasses
0,and file out sarek steps to the bay window looks out
0,in contemplation his back to kirk with the others
0,gone kirk comes up behind sarek a pause then
0,kirk
0,continuing
0,sarek i would have come to
0,vulcan to express my deepest
0,sympathies
0,sarek
0,raises a hand
0,spare me your human platitudes
0,kirk i have been to your
0,government i have seen the
0,genesis information and your own
0,report
0,kirk
0,then you know how bravely your son
0,met his death
0,sarek
0,met his death
0,turning on kirk
0,how could you his friend have
0,assumed that why did you leave
0,him on genesis spock trusted you
0,and you denied him his future
0,kirk
0,i saw no future
0,sarek
0,you missed the point then and
0,now only his body was in
0,death kirk and you were the
0,last one to be with him
0,kirk
0,yes i was
0,sarek
0,then you must know that you should
0,have come with him to vulcan
0,kirk
0,but why
0,sarek
0,because he asked you to he
0,entrusted you with his very
0,essence with everything
0,was not of the body he asked you
0,to bring him to us and to bring
0,that which he gave you his
0,katra his living spirit
0,kirk
0,deeply quietly
0,sir your son meant more to me
0,than you can know id have given
0,my life if it would have saved
0,his you must believe me when i
0,tell you that he made no request
0,of me
0,sarek
0,he would not have spoken of it
0,openly
0,kirk
0,then how
0,sarek
0,interrupting
0,kirk i must have your thoughts
0,may i join your mind
0,kirk
0,of course
0,sarek steps close to kirk as camera pushes in very
0,close sareks hands are on kirks temples in familiar
0,splayed fashion and the eyes of both men are closed
0,mind meld sequence
0,this can be literal or can be illustrated by sub
0,liminal film from trek ii to be determined
0,strange submusical sounds underscore the music of
0,vulcan unlike anything we have ever heard before
0,after a moment
0,sarek
0,he spoke of your friendship
0,kirk
0,semitrance
0,yes
0,sarek
0,he asked you not to grieve
0,kirk
0,yes
0,sarek
0,the needs of the many outweigh
0,kirk
0,the needs of the few
0,sarek
0,or the one

0,spock
0,sarek
0,i have been and always shall

0,forgive me it is not here i
0,assumed he had mindmelded with
0,you it is the vulcan way when
0,the bodys end is near
0,kirk
0,but he couldnt touch me we
0,were separated
0,sarek
0,i see and i understand
0,rises wearily
0,then everything that he was
0,everything that he knew is
0,lost and when i return home
0,emptyhanded many shall mourn
0,he turns now starting for the door kirk stops him
0,with an agonized wail
0,kirk
0,please wait surely he would
0,have found a way if there was so
0,much at stake spock would have
0,found a way
0,sarek
0,hesitating

0,a bystander thinking the alien hit the waitress hits
0,him
0,a general scuffle begins
0,meanwhile mccoy tries to race around the civilians
0,end of the confusion but the agent very big grabs
0,him bones in confusion and panic suddenly turns
0,wildeyed and attempts a vulcan nerve pinch on his
0,tormentor the nerve pinch has absolutely no effect
0,and the agent stares at bones for a long moment
0,civilian
0,youre going to get a nice long
0,rest doctor
0,he ushers bones out as the brouhaha continues in bg

0,it is snowing now and the wind wails as saavik and
0,david appear and come forward into a close shot the
0,life sign sound of their tricorder is beeping faster
0,now as they peer ahead into the snow then saavik
0,suddenly points
0,pov through the snowfall
0,something alive moves across the front obscured by
0,snow and terrain
0,back to them moving camera intercut with pov
0,as they start forward into the snow saavik drawing her
0,phaser they peer ahead seeing nothing but the bleep

0,their pov moving through the snow flurry catches an
0,occasional hint of something ahead which spurs them on
0,then with the tricorder beep indicating very close
0,proximity they stop and intuitively saavik indicates
0,to david to turn the tricorder off as the beep stops
0,they listen and hear the tiniest of whimpers amid the

0,a wild thing with scraggly hair perhaps nine or ten

0,the scene in the crevice
0,at saaviks gesture david turns off his tricorder
0,saavik moves close as she touches the boys leg he
0,pulls back and she reaches out to his face and touches

0,slides her hand slowly and parts the scraggly hair
0,the boy is a vulcan

0,remain hollow filled with questions and uncertainties
0,scene various angles
0,the enterprise crew each of them stares back at spock
0,as subjective camera pans past them slowly each makes his

0,hardest at all at
0,kirk the wind whips his hair
0,something triggers in spock he steps forward and
0,then in an odd rusty voice
0,spock

0,begins walking back to the group he left kirk raises
0,his helpless hand after spock wondering what he might
0,have said should have said when suddenly
0,spock stops back to kirk he closes his eyes looks

0,spock
0,continuing
0,two months ago a federation
0,starship monitored an explosion on
0,the klingon moon praxis we
0,believe it was caused by over mining
0,and insufficient safety precautions
0,the moons decimation means an
0,almost eighty percent loss of
0,available energy and a deadly
0,pollution of their ozone due to
0,their large military expenditures
0,the klingon economy is in a very
0,weakened condition they do not
0,have sufficient resources to
0,manufacture air shelters in large
0,enough quantities to sustain
0,anything like their current
0,population last month at the
0,behest of the uh vulcan
0,ambassador i opened a dialogue
0,with gorkon chancellor of the
0,klingon high council he proposes
0,to commence negotiations at once
0,admiral donald
0,negotiations for what
0,spock
0,the dismantling of our space
0,stations and star bases along the
0,neutral zone an end to seventy
0,years of unremitting hostility a
0,hostility the klingons can no
0,longer afford
0,audible mutterings pan the crew is the war over
0,spock
0,continuing
0,if the klingons sue for peace we
0,could accumulate savings in defense
0,expenditures leaving the
0,federation economy free to grapple
0,with urgent social problems
0,a military man
0,bill are we talking about
0,mothballing the starfleet
0,cinc
0,im sure our exploration and
0,science programs would not be
0,affected but the facts speak for
0,themselves captain
0,admiral donald
0,i must protest to offer the
0,klingons a safe haven within
0,federation space is suicide
0,klingons would become the alien
0,trash of the galaxy and if we
0,dismantle the fleet wed be
0,defenseless before a bellicose
0,people with a foothold on our
0,territory the opportunity which
0,presents itself here is to embargo
0,trading force them to run through
0,their own resources faster and
0,bring them to their knees then
0,well be in a far better position
0,to dictate terms
0,a vocal minority of the briefing supports this but not
0,all kirk simply stares at spock
0,cinc
0,starfleet is under civilian
0,control admiral the decision is
0,a political not a military one
0,and its been made
0,kirk
0,sir
0,cinc
0,captain kirk
0,kirk
0,eyes spock briefly
0,sir im no diplomat but the
0,klingons have never been
0,trustworthy im forced to agree
0,with admiral donald this is
0,he gropes for tact
0,a terrible a terrifying idea
0,cinc
0,your son was killed by a klingon
0,wasnt he captain
0,kirk
0,yes sir
0,cinc
0,im sorry but commander spock has
0,persuaded the federation that this
0,situation is too promising to
0,ignore
0,spock
0,it is imperative that we act now to
0,support the gorkon initiative lest
0,more conservative elements persuade
0,his empire that it would be better
0,to attempt a military solution and
0,die fighting
0,cinc
0,captain kirk you are to be our
0,first olive branch
0,kirk
0,me
0,spock
0,we have volunteered to rendezvous
0,with the klingon ship thats
0,bringing chancellor gorkon here
0,and escort him safely through
0,federation space
0,kirk is too startled to speak
0,cinc
0,as it happens kirk the chancellor
0,specifically requested you and your
0,officers
0,kirk
0,why in gods name
0,cinc
0,there are some klingons who feel
0,the same about the peace treaty as
0,yourself and admiral donald
0,theyll think twice about attacking
0,the enterprise under your command
0,spock
0,i have personally vouched for you
0,in this matter captain
0,kirk
0,you have personally
0,cinc
0,you will accord chancellor gorkon
0,full diplomatic courtesy captain

0,wish you and your crew godspeed
0,thank you all
0,he charges out as all rise everyone files out
0,admiral donald

0,you remember you used to call me

0,spock
0,your use of language has altered

0,laced with shall i say more
0,colorful metaphors double dumb
0,ass on you and so forth
0,kirk
0,you mean profanity thats simply
0,the way they talk here
0,nobody pays any attention to you if
0,you dont swear every other word
0,youll find it in all the literature
0,of the period
0,spock
0,for example

0,good morning im your guide this
0,morning my names dr gillian
0,taylor but you can call me gillian
0,im assistant director of the
0,maritime cetacean institute please
0,follow me and just give a yell if
0,you cant hear okay
0,she starts off all follow
0,
0,gillian
0,continuing
0,the cetacean institute is the only
0,museum in the world exclusively
0,devoted to whales as you can see
0,we have a great seal to offer but
0,that is small compared to what we
0,know or rather what wee dont know
0,about whales the first commonly
0,held misconception is that whales
0,are fish
0,theyre not theyre mammals like
0,us warmblooded needing air to
0,breathe and producing milk to nurse
0,their young they are very old
0,mammals million years give
0,or take
0,during the spiel taylor notices kirk in an odd way
0,they connect hes attractive even in his odd clothes
0,and he pays stricter attention than the average joe
0,a man
0,do whales attack people like in
0,moby dick
0,gillian
0,most whales dont even have teeth
0,they strain vast amounts of tiny
0,shrimp for food and that is the
0,limit of their hostility un
0,fortunately their principle enemy
0,is far more aggressive
0,kirk
0,you mean man
0,gillian
0,to put it mildly since the dawn of
0,time men have harvested whales for
0,a variety of purposes most of which
0,can be achieved synthetically at this
0,point a hundred years ago using
0,handthrown harpoons they did plenty
0,of damage but that was nothing
0,compared to what theyve achieved
0,in this century
0,gillian pushes a button and screens modern whalehunt
0,footage pretty gruesome stuff
0,gillian
0,continuing still
0,emotional for her
0,this is mankinds legacy whales
0,hunted to the brink of extinction
0,virtually gone is the blue whale
0,largest creature ever to inhabit
0,the earth
0,beat
0,despite all attempts at banning
0,whaling there are still countries
0,and pirates currently engaged in
0,slaughter of these inoffensive
0,creatures where the humpback whale
0,once numbered in the hundreds of
0,thousands today there are less than
0,thousand specimens alive and those
0,that are taken are no longer fully
0,grown in addition many of the
0,females are killed still bearing
0,unborn calves
0,the pictures graphically illustrate what shes talking
0,about
0,spock
0,to hunt a species to extinction is
0,not logical
0,
0,gillian
0,bitter
0,whoever said the human race was
0,logical
0,then
0,now if youll follow me ill
0,introduce you to the institutes
0,pride and joy
0,they start after her
0,ext whale tank day ilm elements
0,gillian
0,this is the largest sea water tank
0,in the world and it contains the
0,only two humpback whales in
0,captivity
0,the two whales undulate majestically they are
0,colossal kirk and spock react in awe
0,gillian
0,continuing
0,they are mature humpbacks weighing
0,pounds each they wandered
0,into san francisco bay as calves and
0,were brought here we call them
0,george and gracie
0,kirk
0,excited whisper
0,its perfect spock a male a
0,female together in a contained
0,space can beam them up together
0,and consider ourselves damn lucky
0,spock reacts oddly to this
0,gillian
0,beautiful arent they and
0,extremely intelligent why
0,shouldnt they be theyre swimming
0,around with the largest brains on
0,earth now if youll follow me
0,please
0,the group enters the building spock hangs back kirk
0,does not notice his absence
0,
0,a int building a
0,as gillian continues the tour
0,gillian
0,despite all the things they are
0,teaching us we have to return
0,george and gracie to the open sea
0,kirk
0,whys that
0,gillian
0,well for one thing we simply dont
0,have the money to keep feeding them
0,a couple of tons of shrimp a day
0,kirk
0,how soon
0,gillian
0,soon its too bad because theyre
0,very friendly as you can see ive
0,grown quite attached to them this
0,way
0,she starts down a spiral staircase that winds around
0,the tank the others follow minus spock
0,angle next to tank window lower level
0,gillian stops with her back to the tank
0,gillian
0,heres a much better way to see
0,george and gracie underwater
0,kirk has begun to look for spock but in vain
0,int tank underwater
0,as gillian continues her spiel camera moves in toward
0,the whales and discovers spock in the water swimming
0,to them he approaches one and looks it in the eye
0,the great eye stares back
0,closer angle underwater
0,spock and the whale are a foot apart spock gently
0,puts his hand on the whale a mind meld a shaft of
0,back lightning makes the mood ethereal
0,ext tank
0,over speakers we hear whale song the crowd reacts
0,gillian
0,what youre hearing is whale song it
0,is sung by the male hell sing any
0,where from six to as long as thirty
0,minutes and then start again in
0,the ocean other whales will pick up
0,the song and pass it on
0,now kirk sees spock in the water behind gillian and is
0,in mild shock he watches wildeyed as spock and whale
0,move through the water in mid mindmeld
0,gillian
0,continuing
0,the songs change every year but
0,we still dont know what purpose
0,they serve are they navigational
0,part of the mating ritual or pure
0,communication beyond our comprehension
0,an older woman
0,maybe hes singing to the man
0,as the woman points gillian turns around to see
0,pov spock and whale in tank
0,back to scene
0,
0,gillian
0,what the hell
0,starts out
0,excuse me wait right here
0,she dashes up the stairs as kirk desperately pursues
0,ext edge of tank day
0,spock climbs out and is putting on his robe as gillian
0,comes running to him from a distance followed but
0,kirk
0,gillian
0,who the hell are you what were
0,you doing in there
0,spock turns to kirk for guidance but
0,kirk
0,you heard the lady
0,spock gives it his best logical shot
0,spock
0,attempting the hell to communicate
0,gillian
0,communicate communicate what you
0,have no right to be here
0,spock hesitates
0,kirk
0,come on fellah speak up
0,spock
0,admiral if we were to assume these
0,whales are ours to do with as we
0,please we would be as guilty as
0,those who caused their extinction
0,gillian
0,realizes they are
0,together
0,ohhhkay i dont know what this is
0,about but i want you guys outta
0,here right now or i call the cops

0,kirk
0,well for one thing you havent
0,quite got the hang of it
0,spock
0,i see

0,and another thing it is not
0,always necessary to tell the truth
0,spock
0,i cannot tell a lie
0,kirk
0,you dont have to lie you could
0,exaggerate
0,spock
0,exaggerate

0,they are very unhappy about the way
0,their species has been treated by
0,man
0,kirk
0,they have a right to be

0,chances
0,kirk
0,what does that mean exactly take
0,their chances
0,gillian
0,it means that they will be at risk
0,from whale hunters same as the
0,rest of the humpbacks
0,to spock
0,what did you mean when you said all
0,that stuff back at the institute
0,about extinction
0,spock
0,i meant
0,kirk
0,he meant what you were saying on the

0,way theyre going humpbacks will
0,disappear forever
0,gillian
0,thats not what he said farm boy

0,an impressive glasswalled cubicle separating the boss
0,from the factory chaos nichols leads scotty and bones
0,inside
0,nichols
0,well so much for the tour of our
0,humble plant i must say
0,professor your knowledge of
0,engineering is most impressive
0,bones
0,back home we call him the miracle
0,worker
0,nichols
0,indeed may i offer you gentlemen
0,anything
0,a look between bones and scotty then
0,scotty
0,doctor nichols i might have
0,something to offer you
0,nichols
0,yes
0,scotty
0,i notice youre still working with
0,polymers
0,nichols
0,mystified
0,sill what else would i be working
0,with
0,scotty
0,ah what else indeed let me put it
0,another way how thick would a piece
0,of your plexiglass need to be at
0,feet by feet to withstand the
0,pressure of cubic feet of
0,water
0,nichols
0,thats easy inches we carry
0,stuff that big in stock
0,scotty
0,yes i noticed now suppose just
0,suppose i could show you a way to
0,manufacture a wall that would do the
0,same job but was only an inch thick
0,would that be worth something to
0,you eh
0,nichols
0,are you joking
0,bones
0,he never jokes perhaps the
0,professor could use your computer
0,nichols
0,please
0,he gestures and scotty sits at a nearby macintosh he
0,surveys the machine quizzically clears his throat and
0,in a loud voice says
0,scotty

0,bones steps in quickly picks up the mouse and shoves
0,it into scottys hand scotty looks at the mouse

0,plunges to work furiously

0,
0,an awesome series of figures and graphics are
0,appearing pull back to reveal scotty now master of
0,the keyboard while nichols watches in awe next to

0,and a wondrous three dimensional graphic appears
0,nichols
0,wideeyed
0,transparent aluminum
0,scotty
0,thats the ticket laddie
0,nichols
0,but it would take years just to
0,figure out the dynamics of this
0,matrix
0,bones
0,youll be rich beyond the dreams of
0,avarice
0,scotty
0,so is it worth something or
0,should i just punch clear
0,nichols
0,no
0,then
0,no what did you have in mind
0,bones
0,a moment alone please
0,bones
