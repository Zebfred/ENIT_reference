2024,1,the laws and give us justice you could call for a vote of no confidence
2025,1,in chancellor valorum
2026,1,amidala  he has been our strongest supporter is there any other way
2027,1,palpatine  our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
2028,1,courts
2029,1,amidala  theres no time for that the courts take even longer to decide
2030,1,things than the senate our people are dying senatormore and more each

3251,1,mace windu our intelligence points to disgruntled spice
3252,1,miners on the moons of naboo
3253,1,padm  but i think that count dooku was behind it
3254,1,there is a stir of surprise they look at one another
3255,1,kiadimundi he is a political idealist not a murderer
3256,1,mace windu you know mlady count dooku was once a jedi
3257,1,he couldnt assassinate anyone its not in his character

3566,1,wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid its power
3567,1,shuts off obiwan and the droid drop like rocks obiwan

3576,1,the droid bumps against a wall hoping to knock the jedi
3577,1,loose it moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him
3578,1,it takes the jedi wildly between buildings and finally
3579,1,skims across a rooftop as obiwan is forced to lift his
3580,1,legs tenaciously hanging onto the droid the droid heads
3581,1,for a dirty beatup speeder hidden in an alcove of a
3582,1,building about twenty stories up when the pilot of the
3583,1,speeder the scruffy bounty hunter zam wesell sees the
3584,1,droid approach with obiwan hanging on she pulls a long
3585,1,rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the jedi
3586,1,explosions burst all around obiwan zam runs to her
3587,1,speeder jumps in and takes off
3588,1,obiwan i have a bad feeling about this
3589,1,finally the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up obi
3590,1,wan falls fifty stories until a speeder drops down next to
3591,1,him and he manages to grab onto the back end of the
3592,1,speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit the jedi
3593,1,struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open
3594,1,speeder and sit down next to the driver anakin
3595,1,anakin that was wacky i almost lost you in the traffic
3596,1,obiwan what took you so long
3597,1,anakin oh you know master i couldnt find a speeder i
3598,1,really liked with an open cockpit and with the right
3599,1,speed capabilities and then you know i had to get a
3600,1,really gonzo color
3601,1,they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam as she fires out the
3602,1,open window at them with her laser pistol
3603,1,obiwan if youd spend as much time working on your saber
3604,1,skills as you do on your wit young padawan you would
3605,1,rival master yoda as a swordsman
3606,1,anakin i thought i already did
3607,1,obiwan only in your mind my very young apprentice
3608,1,careful hey easy
3609,1,as this conversation is going on anakin deftly moves in
3610,1,and out of the oncoming traffic across lanes between
3611,1,buildings and miraculously through a construction site
3612,1,zam wesell continues firing at them
3613,1,anakin sorry i forgot you dont like flying master
3614,1,obiwan i dont mind flying but what youre doing is
3615,1,suicide
3616,1,they barely miss a commuter train
3617,1,anakin master you know ive been flying since before i
3618,1,could walk im very good at this
3619,1,obiwan just slow down there there he goes
3620,1,zam wessel and the jedi race through a line of cross
3621,1,traffic made up of giant trucks the speeders bank sideways
3622,1,as they slide around rightangle turns between buildings
3623,1,zam races into a tram tunnel
3624,1,obiwan wait dont go in there take it easy
3625,1,anakin dont worry master
3626,1,anakin zooms into the tunnel after zam they see a tram
3627,1,coming at them they brake turn around and race out
3628,1,barely ahead of the charging commuter transport
3629,1,obiwan you know i dont like it when you do that
3630,1,anakin sorry master dont worry this guys gonna kill
3631,1,himself any minute now
3632,1,zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic deliberately trying
3633,1,to throw the jedi off oncoming speeders swerve trying to
3634,1,avoid zam and the jedi zam does a quick tight loopover
3635,1,and ends up behind the jedi she is now in a much better
3636,1,position to fire at them with her laser pistol to avoid
3637,1,being hit by the laser bolts anakin slams on the brakes
3638,1,and moves alongside zam she now fires pointblank at obi
3639,1,wan
3640,1,obiwan what are you doing hes gonna blast me
3641,1,anakin right  this isnt working
3642,1,anakin slides underneath zams speeder they race along in
3643,1,traffic one speeder right on top of the other the bounty
3644,1,hunter skims over the rooftops causing anakin to drop
3645,1,behind anakin goes through his gears zooming around
3646,1,traffic they race at high speed across a wide flat
3647,1,surface of the city planet a large spacecraft almost
3648,1,collides with them as it attempts to land 
3649,1,obiwan watch out for those banners
3650,1,they round a corner and clip a flag which gets caught on
3651,1,one of the front air scoops
3652,1,obiwan that was too close
3653,1,anakin clear that
3654,1,obiwan what
3655,1,anakin clear the flag were losing power hurry
3656,1,obiwan leans out of the speeder then crawls out onto the
3657,1,front engine and pulls the flag free of the scoop the
3658,1,speeder lurches forward with a surge of power
3659,1,obiwan whooooaaa dont do that i dont  like it when
3660,1,you do that
3661,1,anakin so sorry master
3662,1,they chase the bounty hunter through a power refinery zam
3663,1,shoots a power coupler causing voltage like lightning to
3664,1,jump across a gap from one coupler to another anakin stays
3665,1,on course piloting the speeder directly through the arc
3666,1,anakin and obiwans bodies ripple with blue power
3667,1,obiwan anakin how many times have i told you to stay
3668,1,away from the power couplings slow down dont go through
3669,1,there
3670,1,huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the
3671,1,speeders pass
3672,1,obiwan yiiii what are you doing
3673,1,anakin sorry master
3674,1,obiwan sarcastically oh that was good
3675,1,anakin that was crazy
3676,1,zam slides around a corner sideways blocking an alley
3677,1,firing pointblank as anakin approaches
3678,1,anakin ahh damn
3679,1,obiwan stop
3680,1,anakin no we can make it
3681,1,anakin barely misses the bounty hunters speeder as he
3682,1,dives under it and through a small gap in the building
3683,1,hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control
3684,1,anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder narrowly
3685,1,missing a crane barely clipping a pair of giant struts a
3686,1,giant gas ball shoots up causing anakin to spin and bump a
3687,1,building stalling the speeder
3688,1,obiwan im crazy im crazy im crazy
3689,1,anakin i got us through that one all right
3690,1,obiwan angrily no you didnt weve stalled and you
3691,1,almost got us killed
3692,1,anakin i think were still alive
3693,1,anakin works to get the speeder started it races to life
3694,1,obiwan very angrily it was stupid
3695,1,anakin sheepishly i could have made it
3696,1,obiwan furious but you didnt and now weve lost him
3697,1,for good
3698,1,suddenly there is an ambush laser bolts are everywhere
3699,1,explosions surround them they look up to see zam wessel
3700,1,take off
3701,1,anakin no we didnt
3702,1,out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear
3703,1,after zam they are smoking obiwan slaps out the small
3704,1,fire on the dashboard zam goes up and down through cross
3705,1,traffic there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits
3706,1,them zam turns down and left between two buildings anakin
3707,1,pulls up and to the right
3708,1,obiwan where are you going he went down there the
3709,1,other way
3710,1,anakin master if we keep this chase going that creeps
3711,1,gonna end up deepfried personally id very much like to
3712,1,find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for
3713,1,this is a shortcut i think
3714,1,obiwan sarcastic what do you mean you think
3715,1,anakin turns up a side street zooming up several small
3716,1,passageways then stops hovering about fifty stories up
3717,1,obiwan well you lost him
3718,1,anakin im deeply sorry master
3719,1,anakin looks around front and back he spots something he
3720,1,seems to  start counting to himself as he watches something
3721,1,below approach
3722,1,obiwan well this is some kind of shortcut he went
3723,1,completely the other way once again anakin
3724,1,anakin excuse me for a moment
3725,1,anakin jumps out of the speeder obiwan looks down and
3726,1,sees zams speeder about five stories below them cruising
3727,1,past 
3728,1,obiwan i hate it when he does that
3729,1,anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunters
3730,1,speeder the speeder wobbles under the impact zam looks up
3731,1,and realizes what has happened
3732,1,zam takes off and anakin slides to the back strut and
3733,1,almost slips off but manages to hang on anakin works his
3734,1,way back to zam who caught off guard briefly changes
3735,1,into her clawdite form zam stops suddenly and anakin
3736,1,flies forward to the left front fork zam shoots at him
3737,1,with a laser pistol there is a blast near anakins hand
3738,1,which breaks off a piece of the speeder anakin slides to
3739,1,the right fork of the speeder where zam cant reach him
3740,1,he scrambles to the top holding onto an air scoop
3741,1,obiwan has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder
3742,1,and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder the two
3743,1,speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through
3744,1,cross traffic finally anakin is able to get hold of his
3745,1,lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of
3746,1,the speeder zam takes out her laser pistol and starts
3747,1,firing at the helpless jedi knocking the sword out of his
3748,1,hand obiwan races under the speeder and catches the jedi
3749,1,weapon in the passengers seat
3750,1,anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and using the
3751,1,force pulls the gun out of zams hand she grabs the
3752,1,jedis hand and they struggle for the weapon it goes off
3753,1,blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder the speeder
3754,1,careens wildly out of control zam struggles to pull the
3755,1,speeder out of its nosedive obiwan gets slowed down by
3756,1,traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunters speeder
3757,1,just as the speeder is about to nose dive into the ground
3758,1,zam pulls it out and it slides hard on the pavement in a
3759,1,shower of sparks anakin goes flying into the street
3760,1,exterior entertainment street  night
3761,1,zam exits the crashed speeder and runs anakin picks
3762,1,himself up off the pavement and runs after her down the
3763,1,very crowded street
3764,1,its the seedy underbelly of the city broken sidewalks
3765,1,garish lights reflected in filthy puddles its pretty
3766,1,crowded with various alien lowlifes panhandling droids
3767,1,and the occasional group of upperclass slummers
3768,1,anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the
3769,1,fleeing zam he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd then
3770,1,sees her again the young jedi is having a very difficult
3771,1,time getting through the crowd ahead zam turns in through
3772,1,a door and disappears a nightclub sign is flashing over
3773,1,the door
3774,1,obiwan lands the speeder in the nearby street he gets out
3775,1,and runs through the crowd toward anakin anakin is just
3776,1,about to follow zam into the nightclub when obiwan catches

4154,1,obiwan well dex if droids could think we wouldnt be
4155,1,here would we laughing kamino doesnt sound
4156,1,familiar is it part of the republic
4157,1,dexter jettster no its beyond the outer rim id say
4158,1,about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze toward the
4159,1,south it should be easy to find even for those droids in
4160,1,your archive these kaminoans keep to themselves theyre
4161,1,cloners damned good ones too
4162,1,obiwan picks up the dart holding it midway between them
4163,1,obiwan cloners are they friendly
4164,1,dexter jettster it depends
4165,1,obiwan on what dex
4166,1,dexter grins 
4167,1,dexter jettster on how good your manners are and how
4168,1,big your pocketbook is
4169,1,exterior jedi temple  day
4170,1,the main entrance at the base of the huge temple is
4171,1,bustling with activity all sorts of jedi are coming and
4172,1,going
4173,1,interior jedi temple archive library  day
4174,1,a bronze bust of count dooku stands among a line of other
4175,1,busts of jedi in the archive room obiwan stands in front
4176,1,of it studying the striking features of the chiseled face
4177,1,on the walls lighted computer panels seem to stretch into
4178,1,infinity farther along the room in the background five
4179,1,jedi are seated at tables studying archive material
4180,1,after obiwan studies the bust for a few moments before
4181,1,madame jocasta nu the jedi archivist is standing next to
4182,1,him she is an elderly fraillooking human jedi tough as
4183,1,old boots and smart as a whip
4184,1,jocasta nu did you call for assistance
4185,1,obiwan distracted in thought yes yes i did
4186,1,jocasta nu he has a powerful face doesnt he he was one
4187,1,of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of
4188,1,knowing
4189,1,obiwan i never understood why he quit only twenty jedi
4190,1,have ever left the order
4191,1,jocasta nu sighs the lost twenty count dooku was the
4192,1,most recent and the most painful no one likes to talk
4193,1,about it his leaving was a great loss to the order
4194,1,obiwan what happened
4195,1,jocasta nu well count dooku was always a bit out of step
4196,1,with the decisions of the council much like your old
4197,1,master quigon jinn
4198,1,obiwan surprised really
4199,1,jocasta nu oh yes they were alike in many ways very
4200,1,individual thinkers idealists
4201,1,jocasta nu gazes at the bust
4202,1,jocasta nu he was always striving to become a more
4203,1,powerful jedi he wanted to be the best with a lightsaber
4204,1,in the old style of fencing he had no match his knowledge
4205,1,of the force was unique in the end i think he left
4206,1,because he lost faith in the republic he believed that
4207,1,politics were corrupt and he felt the jedi betrayed
4208,1,themselves by serving the politicians he always had very
4209,1,high expectations of government he disappeared for nine or
4210,1,ten years then just showed up recently as the head of the
4211,1,separatist movement
4212,1,obiwan its very interesting im not sure i completely
4213,1,understand
4214,1,jocasta nu well im sure you didnt call me over here for
4215,1,a history lesson are you having a problem master kenobi
4216,1,obiwan yes im trying to find a planet system called
4217,1,kamino it doesnt seem to show up on any of the archive
4218,1,charts
4219,1,jocasta nu kamino its not a system im familiar with
4220,1,let me see
4221,1,jocasta nu leans over obiwans shoulder looking at the
4222,1,screen
4223,1,jocasta nu are you sure you have the right coordinates
4224,1,obiwan nodding according to my information it should
4225,1,be in this quadrant somewhere just south of the rishi
4226,1,maze
4227,1,jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns
4228,1,jocasta nu no coordinates it sounds like the sort of
4229,1,directions youd get from a street tout some old miner
4230,1,or furbog trader
4231,1,obiwan all three actually
4232,1,jocasta nu are you sure it exists
4233,1,obiwan absolutely
4234,1,jocasta nu let me do a gravitational scan
4235,1,obiwan and jocasta nu study the star map hologram
4236,1,jocasta nu there are some inconsistencies here maybe the
4237,1,planet youre seeking was destroyed
4238,1,obiwan wouldnt that be on record
4239,1,jocasta nu it ought to be unless it was very recent
4240,1,shakes her head i hate to say it but it looks like the
4241,1,system youre searching for doesnt exist
4242,1,obiwan thats impossible perhaps the archives are
4243,1,incomplete
4244,1,jocasta nu the archives are comprehensive and totally
4245,1,secure my young jedi one thing you may be absolutely sure
4246,1,of  if an item does not appear in our records it does not
4247,1,exist
4248,1,obiwan stares at her then looks back to the map jocasta
4249,1,nu notices a young boy approach she turns from obiwan and
4250,1,leaves with the youngster
4251,1,exterior space starship freighter
4252,1,the massive slowmoving freighter moves through space
4253,1,interior starfreighter steerage hold  day
4254,1,the great gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their
4255,1,belongings to one side artoo is coming to the head of a
4256,1,food line holding two bowls with one of his little claw
4257,1,arms he grabs a chunk of something that looks like bread
4258,1,artoo slips a tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large
4259,1,quantity a server sees him
4260,1,server hey no droids
4261,1,artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food
4262,1,line the server shouts after him angrily the little droid
4263,1,moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes
4264,1,to anakin and padm s table where anakin is sound asleep
4265,1,the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare he is very
4266,1,restless
4267,1,anakin no no mom no
4268,1,he is sweating padm  leans over resting her hand on his
4269,1,arm he wakes up with a start then realizes where he is
4270,1,padm  simply looks at him he stares back somewhat
4271,1,confused
4272,1,anakin what
4273,1,padm  you seemed to be having a nightmare
4274,1,anakin looks at padm  a little more closely trying to see
4275,1,if he has revealed any of his secrets she hands him a bowl
4276,1,of mush and bread
4277,1,padm  are you hungry
4278,1,anakin yeah
4279,1,padm  takes the food from artoo and sets it on a makeshift
4280,1,table anakin rises and takes a seat as she places a bowl
4281,1,in front of him
4282,1,anakin thanks
4283,1,padm  we went to lightspeed a while ago
4284,1,anakin looks into padm s eyes
4285,1,anakin i look forward to seeing naboo again ive thought
4286,1,about it every day since i left its by far the most
4287,1,beautiful place ive ever seen
4288,1,padm  is a little unnerved by his intense stare 
4289,1,padm  it may not be as you remember it time changes
4290,1,perception
4291,1,anakin sometimes it does sometimes for the better
4292,1,padm  it must be difficult having sworn your life to the
4293,1,jedi not being able to visit the places you like or
4294,1,do the things you like
4295,1,anakin or be with the people i love
4296,1,padm  are you allowed to love i thought it was forbidden
4297,1,for a jedi
4298,1,anakin attachment is forbidden possession is forbidden
4299,1,compassion which i would define as unconditional love is
4300,1,central to a jedis life so you might say were encouraged
4301,1,to love
4302,1,padm  you have changed so much
4303,1,anakin you havent changed a bit youre exactly the way i
4304,1,remember you in my dreams i doubt if naboo has changed
4305,1,much either
4306,1,padm  it hasnt
4307,1,there is an awkward moment
4308,1,padm  continuing changing the subject you were dreaming
4309,1,about your mother earlier werent you
4310,1,anakin yes i left tatooine so long ago my memory of
4311,1,her is fading i dont want to lose it recently ive been
4312,1,seeing her in my dreams vivid dreams scary dreams i
4313,1,worry about her
4314,1,padm  gives anakin a sympathetic look
4315,1,interior jedi temple main hallway  day
4316,1,obiwan walks through the main hallway to the training
4317,1,area
4318,1,interior jedi temple training veranda  day
4319,1,obiwan comes out onto the veranda and stops watching
4320,1,twenty or so fouryearolds doing training exercises
4321,1,supervised by yoda they wear helmets over their eyes and
4322,1,try to strike little training droids with their miniature
4323,1,lightsabers the droids dance in front of them

4334,1,archive maps
4335,1,yoda lost a planet master obiwan has how
4336,1,embarrassing how embarrassing liam the shades an
4337,1,interesting puzzle gather younglings around the map
4338,1,reader clear your minds and find obiwans wayward planet
4339,1,we will
4340,1,the reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the
4341,1,top the children gather around it obiwan takes out a
4342,1,little glass ball and places it into the bowl the window
4343,1,shades close the reader lights up and projects the star
4344,1,map hologram into the room the children laugh some of
4345,1,them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars obi
4346,1,wan walks into the display
4347,1,obiwan this is where it ought to be but it isnt
4348,1,gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to
4349,1,this spot there should be a star here but there isnt
4350,1,yoda most interesting gravitys silhouette remains but
4351,1,the star and all its planets have disappeared how can this
4352,1,be now younglings in your mind what is the first thing
4353,1,you see an answer a thought anyone
4354,1,there is a brief pause then a child puts his hand up yoda
4355,1,nods
4356,1,jedi child jack master because someone erased it from the
4357,1,archive memory
4358,1,children thats right yes thats what happened someone
4359,1,erased it
4360,1,jedi child may if the planet blew up the gravity would go
4361,1,away
4362,1,obiwan stares yoda chuckles
4363,1,yoda truly wonderful the mind of a child is the padawan
4364,1,is right go to the center of the gravitys pull and find
4365,1,your planet you will
4366,1,yoda and obiwan move away from the children with a hand
4367,1,movement obiwan causes the star map to disappear obiwan
4368,1,uses the force to call the glass ball back to his hand as
4369,1,the two walk into an adjoining room
4370,1,obiwan but master yoda who could have erased information
4371,1,from the archives thats impossible isnt it
4372,1,yoda frowning dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is
4373,1,only a jedi could have erased those files but who and why
4374,1,harder to answer meditate on this i will may the force
4375,1,be with you
4376,1,exterior naboo spaceport  day
4377,1,the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed
4378,1,padm  anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming
4379,1,from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area they
4380,1,exit onto the main plaza
4381,1,exterior naboo palace grand courtyard  afternoon
4382,1,the speeder bus pulls up and stops padm  anakin and
4383,1,artoo get out the great courtyard stretches before them
4384,1,and they see the rosecolored domes of the palace on the 
4385,1,far side artoo whistles they pick up their gear and start
4386,1,to cross the courtyard artoo trundles behind them
4387,1,anakin if i grew up here i dont think id ever leave
4388,1,padm  laughing i doubt that
4389,1,anakin no really when i started my training i was very
4390,1,homesick and very lonely this city and my mom were the
4391,1,only pleasant things i had to think about the problem
4392,1,was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt but
4393,1,i would feel better if i thought about the palace  the way
4394,1,it shimmers in the sunlight  the way the air always smells
4395,1,of flowers
4396,1,padm  and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls the
4397,1,first time i saw the capital i was very young id never
4398,1,seen a waterfall before i thought they were so
4399,1,beautiful i never dreamed one day id live in the
4400,1,palace
4401,1,anakin well tell me did you dream of power and politics
4402,1,when you were a little girl
4403,1,padm  laughing no that was the last thing i thought of
4404,1,but the more history i studied the more i realized how
4405,1,much good politicians could do after school i became a
4406,1,senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew
4407,1,it i was elected queen for the most part it was because
4408,1,of my conviction that reform was possible i wasnt the
4409,1,youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on
4410,1,it im not sure i was old enough im not sure i was
4411,1,ready
4412,1,anakin the people you served thought you did a good job i
4413,1,heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could
4414,1,stay in office
4415,1,padm  popular rule is not democracy annie it gives the
4416,1,people what they want not what they need and truthfully
4417,1,i was relieved when my two terms were up so were my
4418,1,parents they worried about me during the blockade and
4419,1,couldnt wait for it all to be over actually i was hoping
4420,1,to have a family by now my sisters have the most
4421,1,amazing wonderful kids so when the queen asked me to
4422,1,serve as senator i couldnt refuse her
4423,1,anakin i agree i think the republic needs you im glad
4424,1,you chose to serve i feel things are going to happen in
4425,1,our generation that will change the galaxy in profound
4426,1,ways
4427,1,padm  i think so too
4428,1,anakin and padm  walk toward the palace artoo continues to
4429,1,follow
4430,1,interior naboo palace throne room  afternoon
4431,1,queen jamillia is seated on the throne flanked by sio
4432,1,bibble and a couple of advisors four handmaidens stand
4433,1,close by and guards are at the doors
4434,1,queen jamillia weve been worried about you takes her
4435,1,hand im so glad youre safe padm 
4436,1,padm  thank you your highness i only wish i could have
4437,1,served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
4438,1,sio bibble given the circumstances senator you know it
4439,1,was the only decision her highness could have made
4440,1,queen jamillia how many systems have joined count dooku
4441,1,and the separatists
4442,1,padm  thousands and more are leaving the republic every
4443,1,day if the senate votes to create an army im sure its
4444,1,going to push us into a civil war
4445,1,sio bibble its unthinkable there hasnt been a full
4446,1,scale war since the formation of the republic
4447,1,queen jamillia do you see any way through negotiations
4448,1,to bring the separatists back into the republic
4449,1,padm  not if they feel threatened the separatists dont
4450,1,have an army but if they are provoked they will move to
4451,1,defend themselves im sure of that and with no time or
4452,1,money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the
4453,1,commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
4454,1,queen jamillia the armies of commerce why has nothing
4455,1,been done in the senate to restrain them
4456,1,padm  im afraid that despite the chancellors best
4457,1,efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even
4458,1,senators on the payrolls of the guilds
4459,1,sio bibble its outrageous that after all of those
4460,1,hearings and four trials in the supreme court nute gunray
4461,1,is still the viceroy of the trade federation i fear the
4462,1,senate is powerless to resolve this crisis do those money
4463,1,mongers control everything
4464,1,queen jamillia remember counselor the courts were able
4465,1,to reduce the federations armies thats a move in the

4741,1,way it ripples and moves it looked so real but it
4742,1,wasnt
4743,1,anakin sometimes when you believe something to be real
4744,1,it becomes real
4745,1,they look into each others eyes
4746,1,padm  i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass
4747,1,you would lose yourself

4750,1,senses and pulls away

4767,1,ago
4768,1,obiwan you mentioned growth acceleration
4769,1,lama su oh yes its essential otherwise a mature clone
4770,1,would take a lifetime to grow now we can do it in half
4771,1,the time those items you saw on the parade ground were

4773,1,order and theyre already mature

4777,1,exactly alike all about twenty years old dressed in
4778,1,black they are seated at tables eating
4779,1,lama su youll find they are totally obedient taking any
4780,1,order without question we modified their genetic structure
4781,1,to make them less independent than the original host 
4782,1,obiwan who was the original host
4783,1,lama su a bounty hunter called jango fett we felt a jedi
4784,1,would be the perfect choice but sifodyas handpicked
4785,1,jango fett himself
4786,1,obiwan where is this bounty hunter now
4787,1,lama su oh we keep him here

4792,1,lama su apart from his pay which is considerable fett
4793,1,demanded only one thing  an unaltered clone for himself
4794,1,curious isnt it
4795,1,obiwan unaltered
4796,1,lama su pure genetic replication no tampering with the
4797,1,structure to make it more docile and no growth
4798,1,acceleration

4810,1,padm  i dont know
4811,1,anakin sure you do you just dont want to tell me
4812,1,padm  are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on
4813,1,me

4818,1,years older then i very cute dark curly hair

4825,1,padm  you really dont like politicians do you
4826,1,anakin i like two or three but im not really sure about
4827,1,one of them smiling i dont think the system works
4828,1,padm  how would you have it work
4829,1,anakin we need a system where the politicians sit down and
4830,1,discuss the problem agree whats in the best interests of
4831,1,all the people and then do it
4832,1,padm  that is exactly what we do the trouble is that
4833,1,people dont always agree in fact they hardly ever do
4834,1,anakin then they should be made to
4835,1,padm  by whom whos going to make them
4836,1,anakin i dont know someone

4856,1,throws more fruit at him he manages to juggle them too
4857,1,until there are too many and he loses control and ducks
4858,1,letting food fall on his head they both laugh
4859,1,anakin stands in front of a shaak yelling at it and waving
4860,1,his arms padm  starts laughing as anakin runs in circles

4866,1,loses his balance and falls off padm  laughs even harder
4867,1,anakin lies still concerned padm  jumps up and runs to
4868,1,where anakin is face down in the grass 
4869,1,padm  annie annie are you all right

4872,1,he catches her arm she struggles they roll over in the
4873,1,grass embracing and looking into each others eyes
4874,1,suddenly they become aware of the contact between them
4875,1,they let go of each other quickly and sit up looking away
4876,1,anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her she takes
4877,1,it he pulls her up and now they are easy together not
4878,1,selfconscious any more padm  scrambles up onto the shaak
4879,1,behind anakin she puts her arms around his waist and leans
4880,1,against his back anakin digs his heels in the shaak
4881,1,starts forward and they ride away

5174,1,along the platform surface as obiwan slides toward some
5175,1,columns he manages to maneuver himself into a roll avoiding

5177,1,and pulling himself to his feet obiwan pulls with all his
5178,1,weight against the momentum of the wire causing jango to
5179,1,drop and crash into the ground jangos rocketpack breaks

6934,1,the two jedi cut their way down several floors into a large generator room huge explosions outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break and fluid is spewing everywhere the jedi get up and turn off their light sabers anakin dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it
6935,1,obiwan    fuel the slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion thats why theyve stopped shooting
6936,1,anakin well then were safe for the time being
6937,1,obiwan your idea of safe is not the same as mine
6938,1,they run explosions rattle the ship and pipes continue to burst around them spilling more fuel into the hallway at the far end six super battle droids drop into the fuel the sounds of shield doors closing and locking echo throughout the hallway they pass several large power generators which are topped with sparking excess power dischargers

6944,1,obiwan well never get through that its too small
6945,1,they move toward a second vent obiwan is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling anakin feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent he closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening then he moves on obiwan is forced into handtohand combat with one of the super battle droids it pulls the jedi under the fuel just before he is about to drown obiwan disables the super battle droid by pushing him into an exhaust pipe
6946,1,the fuel is up to the jedis chins anakin finds a very very small metal grate then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose
6947,1,anakin i found our escape vent

7440,1,palpatine they will report to me    personally the senate is too unfocused to conduct a war this will bring a quick end to things
7441,1,anakin i agree but the jedi council may not see it that way
7442,1,palpatine there are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security
7443,1,anakin with all due respect sir the council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments
7444,1,palpatine thank you my friend but in this case i have no choice    this war must be won
7445,1,anakin everyone will agree on that
7446,1,palpatine anakin ive known you since you were a small boy i have advised you over the years when i could  i am very proud of your accomplishments you have won many battles the jedi council thought were lost    and you saved my life i hope you trust me anakin

7450,1,palpatine i fear the jedi the council keeps pushing for more control theyre shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy    ideals i find simply incomprehensible in a democracy
7451,1,anakin i can assure you that the jedi are dedicated to the values of the republic sir
7452,1,palpatine nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words im depending on you
7453,1,anakin for what i dont understand

7455,1,anakin thinks about this

7471,1,mon mothma we are not separatists trying to leave the republic we are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the republic
7472,1,bail organa it has become increasingly clear to many of us that the chancellor has become an enemy of democracy

7474,1,glddean danu senator i fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the senate

7477,1,padme say no more senator organa i understand at this point its better to leave some things unsaid

7502,1,kladimundi what about the droid attack on the wookiees
7503,1,mace it is critical we send an attack group there immediately

7513,1,obiwan calm down anakin you have been given a great honor to be on the council at your age    its never happened before listen to me anakin the fact of the matter is youre too close to the chancellor the council doesnt like it when he interferes in jedi affairs
7514,1,anakin i swear to you i didnt ask to be put on the council   
7515,1,obiwan but its what you wanted your friendship with chancellor palpatine seems to have paid off
7516,1,anakin that has nothing to do with this
7517,1,obiwan anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation
7518,1,anakin you mean divided loyalties
7519,1,obiwan i warned you there was tension between the council and the chancellor i was very clear why didnt you listen you walked right into it
7520,1,anakin the council is upset im the youngest to ever serve
7521,1,obiwan no it is not anakin i worry when you speak of jealousy and pride those are not jedi thoughts theyre dangerous dark thoughts
7522,1,anakin master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities i know where my loyalties lie
7523,1,obiwan i hope so   
7524,1,anakin i sense theres more to this talk than youre saying
7525,1,obiwan anakin the only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you
7526,1,anakin and
7527,1,obiwan anakin look i am on your side i didnt want to see you put in this situation
7528,1,anakin what situation
7529,1,obiwan takes a deep breath the council wants you to report on all of the chancellors dealings they want to know what hes up to
7530,1,anakin they want me to spy on the chancellor thats treason
7531,1,obiwan we are at war anakin the jedi council is sworn to uphold the principles of the republic even if the chancellor does not
7532,1,anakin why didnt the council give me this assignment when we were in session

7579,1,anakin i may be on the council but    they refused to accept me as a jedi master
7580,1,padme patience in time they will recognize your skills
7581,1,anakin they still treat me as if i were a padawan learner   they fear my power thats the problem
7582,1,padme anakin   
7583,1,anakin sometimes i wonder whats happening to the jedi order    i think this war is destroying the principles of the republic
7584,1,padme have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side
7585,1,anakin suspicious what do you mean
7586,1,padme what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy
7587,1,anakin i dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist
7588,1,padme anakin this war represents a failure to listen    now youre closer to the chancellor than anyone please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume
7589,1,anakin growing angry dont ask me to do that padme make a motion in the senate where that kind of a request belongs im not your errand boy im not anyones errand boy

7604,1,anakin you wanted to see me chancellor
7605,1,palpatine yes anakin come closer i have good news our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of general grievous he is hiding in the utapau system
7606,1,anakin at last well be able to capture that monster and end this war
7607,1,palpatine i would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if they didnt select you for this assignment you are the best choice by far   but they cant always be trusted to do the right thing
7608,1,anakin they try
7609,1,palpatine sit down to his aides leave us
7610,1,anakin sits next to palpatine the chancellor leans over to him
7611,1,palpatine continuing anakin you know im not able to rely on the jedi council if they havent included you in their plot they soon will
7612,1,anakin im not sure i understand
7613,1,palpatine you must sense what i have come to suspect    the jedi council want control of the republic    theyre planning to betray me
7614,1,anakin i dont think   
7615,1,palpatine anakin search your feelings you know dont you
7616,1,anakin i know they dont trust you   
7617,1,palpatine or the senate    or the republic    or democracy for that matter
7618,1,anakin i have to admit my trust in them has been shaken
7619,1,palpatine why they asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didnt they
7620,1,anakin doesnt say anything he simply looks down
7621,1,palpatine continuing they asked you to spy on me didnt they
7622,1,anakin i dont know  i dont know what to say
7623,1,palpatine remember back to your early teachings anakin all those who gain power are afraid to lose it even the jedi
7624,1,anakin the jedi use their power for good
7625,1,palpatine good is a point of view anakin and the jedi point of view is not the only valid one the dark lords of the sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the jedi to be  
7626,1,anakin    evil
7627,1,palpatine    from a jedis point of view the sith and the jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power the difference between the two is the sith are not afraid of the dark side of the force that is why they are more powerful
7628,1,anakin the sith rely on their passion for their strength they think inward only about themselves
7629,1,palpatine and the jedi dont
7630,1,anakin the jedi are selfless    they only care about others
7631,1,palpatine smiles
7632,1,palpatine or so youve been trained to believe why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong
7633,1,anakin im not sure its wrong
7634,1,palpatine have they asked you to betray the jedi code the constitution a friendship your own values think consider their motives keep your mind clear of assumptions the fear of losing power is a weakness of both the jedi and the sith
7635,1,anakin is deep in thought
7636,1,palpatine continuing did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
7637,1,anakin no
7638,1,palpatine i thought not its not a story the jedi would tell you its a sith legend darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life  he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying
7639,1,anakin he could actually save people from death
7640,1,palpatine the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
7641,1,anakin what happened to him
7642,1,palpatine he became so powerful    the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep smiles plagueis never saw it coming its ironic he could save others from death but not himself
7643,1,anakin is it possible to learn this power
7644,1,palpatine not from a jedi

7652,1,yoda act on this we must the capture of general grievous will end this war quickly and decisively we should proceed
7653,1,obiwan does everyone agree

7658,1,kladimundi yes this decision is ours to make
7659,1,anakin is embarrassed and becomes sullen
7660,1,yoda a master is needed with more experience
7661,1,mace given our resources i recommend we send only one jedi    master kenobi
7662,1,anakin he was not so successful the last time he met grievous
7663,1,obiwan throws anakin a dirty look
7664,1,anakin continuing no offense my master but im only stating a fact

8896,1, luke and im stuck here
8897,1, biggs i thought you were going to the academy next term  youll get your chance to get off this rock
8898,1, luke not likely  i had to cancel my application  there has been a lot of unrest among the sand people since you left theyve even raided the outskirts of anchorhead
8899,1, biggs your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sand people with one blaster
8900,1, luke i know but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off  he needs me for just one more season  i cant leave him now
8901,1, biggs i feel for you luke youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important  what good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the empire  you know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systemsit wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the empire
8902,1, luke it couldnt happen here  you said it yourself  the empire wont bother with this rock
8903,1, biggs things always change

8921,1, owen what i really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators
8922,1, threepio vaporators  sir  my first job was programming binary load lifters very similar to your vaporators  you could say
8923,1, owen do you speak bocce

8973,1, threepio behave yourself artoo  youre going to get us in trouble  its all right you can trust him  hes our new master
8974,1, threepio he says hes the property of obiwan kenobi a resident of these parts  and its a private message for him  quite frankly sir i dont know what hes talking about  our last master was captain antilles but with what weve been through this little r unit has become a bit eccentric
8975,1, luke obiwan kenobi  i wonder if he means old ben kenobi
8976,1, threepio i beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about
8977,1, luke well i dont know anyone named obiwan but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea  hes kind of a strange old hermit
8978,1, luke i wonder who she is  it sounds like shes in trouble  id better play back the whole thing
8979,1, threepio he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system  he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording
8980,1, luke hm  oh yeah well i guess youre too small to run away on me if i take this off  okay
8981,1, luke there you go
8982,1, luke well wait a minute  whered she go  bring her back  play back the entire message

8989,1, threepio no i dont think he likes you at all
8990,1, threepio no i dont like you either
8991,1, luke you know i think that r unit we bought might have been stolen
8992,1, owen what makes you think that
8993,1, luke well i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him  he says he belongs to someone called obiwan kenobi
8994,1, luke i thought he might have meant ben  do you know what hes talking about  well i wonder if hes related to ben
8995,1, owen that old mans just a crazy wizard  tomorrow i want you to take that r unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed  thatll be the end of it  it belongs to us now
8996,1, luke but what if this obiwan comes looking for him
8997,1, owen he wont i dont think he exists any more  he died about the same time as your father
8998,1, luke he knew my father
8999,1, owen i told you to forget it  your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow  in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers
9000,1, luke yes sir  i think those new droids are going to work out fine  in fact i uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season  and if these new droids do work out i want to transmit my application to the academy this year
9001,1, owen you mean the next semester before harvest
9002,1, luke sure therere more than enough droids
9003,1, owen harvest is when i need you the most  only one more season  this year well make enough on the harvest so ill be able to hire some more hands  and then you can go to the academy next year
9004,1, owen you must understand i need you here luke
9005,1, luke but its a whole nother year
9006,1, owen look its only one more season
9007,1, luke yeah thats what you said last year when biggs and tank left
9008,1, aunt beru where are you going
9009,1, luke it looks like im going nowhere  i have to finish cleaning those droids
9010,1, aunt beru owen he cant stay here forever  most of his friends have gone  it means so much to him
9011,1, owen ill make it up to him next year  i promise
9012,1, aunt beru lukes just not a farmer owen  he has too much of his father in him
9013,1, owen thats what im afraid of
9014,1, luke what are you doing hiding there
9015,1, threepio it wasnt my fault sir  please dont deactivate me  i told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission
9016,1, luke oh no
9017,1, threepio that r unit has always been a problem  these astrodroids are getting quite out of hand  even i cant understand their logic at times 
9018,1, luke how could i be so stupid  hes nowhere in sight  blast it
9019,1, threepio pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him
9020,1, luke its too dangerous with all the sand people around  well have to wait until morning
9021,1, owen luke im shutting the power down for the night
9022,1, luke all right ill be there in a few minutes  boy am i gonna get it
9023,1, luke you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble
9024,1, threepio oh he excels at that sir
9025,1, owen luke  luke  luke  where could he be loafing now
9026,1, owen have you seen luke this morning
9027,1, aunt beru he said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early
9028,1, owen uh  did he take those two new droids with him
9029,1, aunt beru i think so
9030,1, owen well hed better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or therell be hell to pay
9031,1, luke hows that
9032,1, luke old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but i dont see how that r unit could have come this far  we must have missed him  uncle owen isnt going to take this very well
9033,1, threepio sir would it help if you told him it was my fault
9034,1, luke sure  he needs you  hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so
9035,1, threepio deactivate  well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt
9036,1, luke wait theres something dead ahead on the scanner  it looks like our droid hit the accelerator
9037,1, luke hey whoa just where do you think youre going
9038,1, threepio master luke here is your rightful owner  well have no more of this obiwan kenobi jibberish and dont talk to me of your mission either  youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here
9039,1, luke well come on its getting late  i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up
9040,1, threepio if you dont mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop
9041,1, luke no hes not going to try anything
9042,1, luke whats wrong with him now
9043,1, threepio oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast
9044,1, luke sand people  or worse  come on lets have a look  come on
9045,1, luke there are two banthas down there but i dont see any wait a second theyre sand people all right  i can see one of them now
9046,1, ben hello there  come here my little friend  dont be afraid
9047,1, ben dont worry hell be all right
9048,1, luke what happened
9049,1, ben rest easy son youve had a busy day  youre fortunate youre still in one piece
9050,1, luke ben  ben kenobi  boy am i glad to see you 
9051,1, ben the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly  tell me young luke what brings you out this far
9052,1, luke oh this little droid  i think hes searching for his former master  ive never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems tobe no stopping him  he claims to be the property of an obiwan kenobi  is he a relative of yours  do you know who hes talking about
9053,1, ben obiwan kenobi obiwan  now thats a name i havent heard in a long time a long time
9054,1, luke i think my uncle knew him  he said he was dead
9055,1, ben oh hes not dead no not yet
9056,1, luke you know him
9057,1, ben well of course of course i know him  hes me  i havent gone by the name obiwan since oh before you were born
9058,1, luke then the droid does belong to you
9059,1, ben dont seem to remember ever owning a droid  very interesting 
9060,1, ben i think we better get indoors  the sand people are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers
9061,1, luke  threepio
9062,1, threepio where am i  i must have taken a bad step
9063,1, luke can you stand  weve got to get out of here before the sand people return
9064,1, threepio i dont think i can make it  you go on master luke  theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account  im done for
9065,1, luke no youre not  what kind of talk is that
9066,1, ben quickly son theyre on the move
9067,1, luke no my father didnt fight in the wars  he was a navigator on a spice freighter
9068,1, ben thats what your uncle told you  he didnt hold with your fathers ideals  thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved
9069,1, luke you fought in the clone wars
9070,1, ben yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father
9071,1, luke i wish id known him
9072,1, ben he was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior  i understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself  and he was a good friend  which reminds me
9073,1, ben i have something here for you  your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it  he feared you might follow old obiwan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did 
9074,1, threepio sir if youll not be needing me ill close down for awhile
9075,1, luke sure go ahead
9076,1, luke what is it
9077,1, ben your fathers lightsaber  this is the weapon of a jedi knight  not as clumsy or as random as a blaster
9078,1, ben an elegant weapon for a morecivilized time  for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic  before the dark times before the empire
9079,1, luke how did my father die
9080,1, ben a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights  he betrayed and murdered your father  now the jedi are all but extinct  vader was seduced by the dark side of the force
9081,1, luke the force
9082,1, ben well the force is what gives the jedi his power  its an energy field created by all living things  it surrounds us and penetrates us  it binds the galaxy together
9083,1, ben now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend  and where you come from
9084,1, luke i saw part of the message he was
9085,1, ben i seem to have found it
9086,1, leia general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars  now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire  i regret that i am unable to present my fathers request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and im afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed  i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r unit  my father will know how to retrieve it  you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan  this is our most desperate hour  help me obiwan kenobi youre my only hope
9087,1, ben you must learn the ways of the force if youre to come with me to alderaan
9088,1, luke alderaan  im not going to alderaan  ive got to go home  its late im in for it as it is
9089,1, ben i need your help luke  im getting too old for this sort of thingshe needs your help
9090,1, luke i cant get involved  ive got work to do  its not that i like the empire  i hate it  but theres nothing i can do about it right now  its such a long way from here
9091,1, ben thats your uncle talking
9092,1, luke oh god my uncle  how am i ever going to explain this
9093,1, ben learn about the force luke
9094,1, luke look i can take you as far as anchorhead  you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever youre going
9095,1, ben you must do what you feel is right of course
9096,1, tagge until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable  the rebel alliance is too well equipped  theyre more dangerous than you realize
9097,1, motti dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station
9098,1, tagge the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate as long as
9099,1, tarkin the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us  ive just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently  the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away
9100,1, tagge thats impossible  how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy
9101,1, tarkin the regional governors now have direct control over territories  fear will keep the local systems in line  fear of this battle station
9102,1, tagge and what of the rebellion  if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it
9103,1, vader the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands
9104,1, motti any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data theyve obtained  this station is now the ultimate power in the universe  i suggest we use it
9105,1, vader dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed  the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force
9106,1, motti dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways lord vader  your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels hidden fort
9107,1, vader i find your lack of faith disturbing
9108,1, tarkin enough of this  vader release him
9109,1, vader as you wish
9110,1, tarkin this bickering is pointless  lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational  we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke
9111,1, luke it looks like sand people did this all right  look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks  its just i never heard of them hitting anything this big before
9112,1, ben they didnt  but we are meant to think they did  these tracks are side by side  sand people always ride single file to hide there numbers
9113,1, luke these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio
9114,1, ben and these blast points too accurate for sand people  only imperial stormtroopers are so precise
9115,1, luke why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas
9116,1, luke if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to  and that would lead them back home
9117,1, ben wait luke  its too dangerous
9118,1, luke uncle owen  aunt beru  uncle owen
9119,1, vader and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base
9120,1, ben theres nothing you could have done luke had you been there  youd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire
9121,1, luke i want to come with you to alderaan  theres nothing here for me now  i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father
9122,1, ben mos eisley spaceport  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy  we must be cautious
9123,1, trooper how long have you had these droids
9124,1, luke about three or four seasons
9125,1, ben theyre for sale if you want them
9126,1, trooper let me see your identification
9127,1, ben you dont need to see his identification
9128,1, trooper we dont need to see his identification
9129,1, ben looking for
9130,1, trooper these are not the droids were looking for
9131,1, ben he can go about his business
9132,1, trooper you can go about your business
9133,1, ben move along
9134,1, trooper move along  move along
9135,1, threepio i cant abide these jawas  disgusting creatures
9136,1, luke go on go on  i cant understand how we got by those troopers  i thought we were dead
9137,1, ben the force can have a strong influence on the weakminded  you will find it a powerful ally
9138,1, luke do you really think were going to find a pilot here thatll take us to alderaan
9139,1, ben well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here  only watch your step  this place can be a little rough
9140,1, luke im ready for anything
9141,1, threepio come along artoo
9142,1, bartender we dont serve their kind here
9143,1, luke what
9144,1, bartender your droids theyll have to wait outside  we dont want them here
9145,1, luke listen why dont you wait out by the speeder  we dont want any trouble
9146,1, threepio i heartily agree with you sir
9147,1, creature negola dewaghi wooldugger
9148,1, human he doesnt like you
9149,1, luke im sorry
9150,1, human i dont like you either
9151,1, human dont insult us  you just watch yourself  were wanted men  i have the death sentence on twelve systems
9152,1, luke ill be careful than
9153,1, human youll be dead
9154,1, ben this little one isnt worth the effort  come let me buy you something
9155,1, bartender no blasters  no blaster
9156,1, ben this is chewbacca  hes firstmate on a ship that might suit our needs
9157,1, threepio i dont like the look of this
9158,1, han han solo  im captain of the millennium falcon  chewie here tells me youre looking for passage to the alderaan system
9159,1, ben yes indeed  if its a fast ship
9160,1, han fast ship  youve never heard of the millennium falcon
9161,1, ben should i have
9162,1, han its the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
9163,1, han ive outrun imperial starships not the local bulkcruisers mind you  im talking about the big corellian ships now  shes fast enough for you old man  whats the cargo
9164,1, ben only passengers  myself the boy two droids and no questions asked
9165,1, han what is it  some kind of local trouble
9166,1, ben lets just say wed like to avoid any imperial entanglements
9167,1, han well thats the real trick isnt it  and its going to cost you something extra  ten thousand in advance
9168,1, luke ten thousand  we could almost buy our own ship for that
9169,1, han but whos going to fly it kid  you
9170,1, luke you bet i could  im not such a bad pilot myself  we dont have to sit here and listen
9171,1, ben we havent that much with us  but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan
9172,1, han seventeen huh
9173,1, han okay  you guys got yourself a ship  well leave as soon as youre ready  docking bay ninetyfour
9174,1, ben ninetyfour
9175,1, han looks like somebodys beginning to take an interest in your handiwork
9176,1, trooper all right well check it out
9177,1, han seventeen thousand  those guys must really be desperate  this could really save my neck  get back to the ship and get her ready
9178,1, ben youll have to sell your speeder
9179,1, luke thats okay  im never coming back to this planet again
9180,1, greedo going somewhere solo
9181,1, han yes greedo  as a matter of fact i was just going to see your boss  tell jabba that ive got his money
9182,1, greedo its too late  you should have paid him when you had the chance  jabbas put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you  im lucky i found you first
9183,1, han yeah but this time i got the money
9184,1, greedo if you give it to me i might forget i found you
9185,1, han i dont have it with me  tell jabba
9186,1, greedo jabbas through with you  he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser
9187,1, han even i get boarded sometimes  do you think i had a choice
9188,1, greedo you can tell that to jabba  he may only take your ship
9189,1, han over my dead body
9190,1, greedo thats the idea ive been looking forward to killing you for a long time
9191,1, han yes ill bet you have
9192,1, han sorry about the mess
9193,1, vader her resistance to the mind probe is considerable  it will be some time before we can extract any information from her
9194,1, imperial officer the final checkout is complete  all systems are operational  what course shall we set
9195,1, tarkin perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion
9196,1, vader what do you mean
9197,1, tarkin i think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this stationset your course for princess leias home planet of alderaan
9198,1, trooper with pleasure
9199,1, threepio lock the door artoo
9200,1, trooper all right check that side of the street  its secure  move on to the next door
9201,1, threepio i would much rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you  i dont know what all this trouble is about but im sure it must be your fault
9202,1, threepio you watch your language
9203,1, luke he says its the best he can do  since the xp came out they 
9204,1, ben it will be enough
9205,1, ben if the ships as fast as hes boasting we ought to do well
9206,1, jabba come on out solo
9207,1, han ive been waiting for you jabba
9208,1, jabba i expected you would be
9209,1, han im not the type to run
9210,1, jabba han my boy there are times when you disappoint me why havent you paid me  and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that after all weve been through together
9211,1, han you sent greedo to blast me
9212,1, jabba han why youre the best smuggler in the business  youre too valuable to fry  he was only relaying my concern at your delays  he wasnt going to blast you
9213,1, han i think he thought he was  next time dont send one of those twerps  if youve got something to say to me come see me yourself
9214,1, jabba han han  if only you hadnt had to dump that shipment of spice you understand i just cant make an exception  where would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an imperial starship  its not good business
9215,1, han you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba  i had no choice but ive gota charter now and i can pay you back plus a little extra  i just need some more time
9216,1, jabba put your blasters away  han my boy im only doing this because youre the best and i need you  so for an extra say twenty percent ill give you a little more time but this is it  if you disappoint me again ill put a price on your head so large you wont be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life
9217,1, han jabba ill pay you because its my pleasure
9218,1, luke what a piece of junk
9219,1, han shell make point five beyond the speed of light  she may not look like much but shes got it where it counts kid  ive added some special modifications myself
9220,1, han were a little rushed so if youll hurry aboard well get out of here
9221,1, threepio hello sir
9222,1, trooper which way
9223,1, trooper all right men  load your weapons
9224,1, trooper stop that ship
9225,1, trooper blast em
9226,1, han chewie get us out of here
9227,1, threepio oh my  id forgotten how much i hate space travel
9228,1, han it looks like an imperial cruiser  our passengers must be hotter than i thought  try and hold them off  angle the deflector shield while i make the calculations for the jump to light speed
9229,1, han stay sharp  there are two more coming in theyre going to try to cut us off
9230,1, luke why dont you outrun them  i thought you said this thing was fast
9231,1, han watch your mouth kid or youre going to find yourself floating home  well be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace  besides i know a few maneuvers well lose them
9232,1, han heres where the fun begins
9233,1, ben how long before you can make the jump to light speed
9234,1, han itll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer
9235,1, luke are you kidding  at the rate theyre gaining
9236,1, han traveling through hyperspace isnt like dusting crops boy  without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick wouldnt it
9237,1, luke whats that flashing
9238,1, han were losing our deflector shield  go strap yourself in im going to make the jump to light speed
9239,1, motti weve entered the alderaan system
9240,1, leia governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vaders leash  i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board
9241,1, tarkin charming to the last  you dont know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life
9242,1, leia to take the responsibility yourself
9243,1, tarkin princess leia before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational  no star system will dare oppose the emperor now
9244,1, leia the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers
9245,1, tarkin not after we demonstrate the power of this station  in a way you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first  since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base i have chosen to test this stations destructive power on your home planet of alderaan
9246,1, leia no  alderaan is peaceful  we have no weapons  you cant possibly
9247,1, tarkin you would prefer another target  a military target  then name the system
9248,1, tarkin i grow tired of asking this  so itll be the last time  where is the rebel base
9249,1, leia dantooine
9250,1, leia theyre on dantooine
9251,1, tarkin there  you see lord vader she can be reasonable continue with the operation  you may fire when ready
9252,1, leia what
9253,1, tarkin youre far too trusting  dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration  but dont worry  we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough 
9254,1, leia no
9255,1, vader commence primary ignition
9256,1, luke are you all right  whats wrong
9257,1, ben i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced  i fear something terrible has happened
9258,1, ben youd better get on with your exercises
9259,1, han well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs  i told you id outrun em
9260,1, han dont everyone thank me at once
9261,1, han anyway we should be at alderaan about ohtwohundred hours
9262,1, threepio now be careful artoo
9263,1, threepio he made a fair move  screaming about it wont help you
9264,1, han let him have it its not wise to upset a wookiee
9265,1, threepio but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid
9266,1, han thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose  wookiees are known to do that
9267,1, threepio i see your point sir  i suggest a new strategy artoo  let the wookiee win
9268,1, ben remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him
9269,1, luke you mean it controls your actions
9270,1, ben partially but it also obeys your commands
9271,1, han hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid
9272,1, luke you dont believe in the force do you
9273,1, han kid ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other  ive seen a lot of strange stuff but ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one allpowerful force controlling everything  theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny
9274,1, han its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense
9275,1, ben i suggest you try it again luke
9276,1, ben this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct
9277,1, luke with the blast shield down i cant even see  how am i supposed to fight
9278,1, ben your eyes can deceive you  dont trust them
9279,1, ben stretch out with your feelings
9280,1, ben you see you can do it
9281,1, han i call it luck 
9282,1, ben in my experience theres no such thing as luck
9283,1, han look going good against remotes is one thing  going good against the living  thats something else
9284,1, han looks like were coming up on alderaan
9285,1, luke you know i did feel something  i could almost see the remote
9286,1, ben thats good  you have taken your first step into a larger world
9287,1, tarkin yes
9288,1, officer cass our scout ships have reached dantooine  they found the remains of a rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time  they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems
9289,1, tarkin she lied  she lied to us
9290,1, vader i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion
9291,1, tarkin terminate her immediately
9292,1, han stand by chewie here we go  cut in the sublight engines
9293,1, han what the  aw weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower  some kind of asteroid collision  its not on any of the charts
9294,1, luke whats going on
9295,1, han our position is correct except no alderaan
9296,1, luke what do you mean  where is it
9297,1, han thats what im trying to tell you kid  it aint there  its been totally blown away
9298,1, luke what  how
9299,1, ben destroyed by the empire
9300,1, han the entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet  itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than ive
9301,1, han theres another ship coming in
9302,1, luke maybe they know what happened
9303,1, ben its an imperial fighter
9304,1, luke it followed us
9305,1, ben no  its a short range fighter
9306,1, han there arent any bases around here  where did it come from
9307,1, luke it sure is leaving in a big hurry  if they identify us were in big trouble
9308,1, han not if i can help it  chewie jam its transmissions
9309,1, ben itd be as well to let it go  its too far out of range
9310,1, han not for long
9311,1, ben a fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own
9312,1, luke then he must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something
9313,1, han well he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us
9314,1, luke look at him  hes heading for that small moon
9315,1, han i think i can get him before he gets there hes almost in range
9316,1, ben thats no moon  its a space station
9317,1, han its too big to be a space station
9318,1, luke i have a very bad feeling about this
9319,1, ben turn the ship around
9320,1, han yeah i think your right  full reverse  chewie lock in the auxiliary power
9321,1, luke why are we still moving towards it
9322,1, han were caught in a tractor beam  its pulling us in
9323,1, luke but theres gotta be something you can do
9324,1, han theres nothin i can do about it kid  im in full power  im going to have to shut down  but theyre not going to get me without a fight
9325,1, ben you cant win  but there are alternatives to fighting
9326,1, voice over death star intercom clear bay twentythreeseven  we are opening the magnetic field
9327,1, officer to your stations
9328,1, officer come with me
9329,1, officer close all outboard shields  close all outboard shields
9330,1, tarkin yes
9331,1, voice weve captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system  its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley
9332,1, vader they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess  she may yet be of some use to us
9333,1, voice unlock onefiveseven and nine release charges
9334,1, officer theres no one on board sir  according to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff  it must be a decoy sir  several of the escape pods have been jettisoned
9335,1, vader did you find any droids
9336,1, officer no sir  if there were any on board they must also have jettisoned
9337,1, vader send a scanning crew on board  i want every part of this ship checked
9338,1, officer yes sir
9339,1, vader i sense something a presence i havent felt since
9340,1, officer get me a scanning crew in here on the double  i want every part of this ship checked
9341,1, luke boy its lucky you had these compartments
9342,1, han i use them for smuggling  i never thought id be smuggling myself in them  this is ridiculous  even if i could take off id never get past the tractor beam
9343,1, ben leave that to me
9344,1, han damn fool i knew that you were going to say that
9345,1, ben whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him
9346,1, trooper the ships all yours  if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately  all right lets go
9347,1, han hey down there could you give us a hand with this
9348,1, gantry officer txfouronetwo  why arent you at your post  txfouronetwo do you copy 
9349,1, gantry officer take over  weve got a bad transmitter  ill see what i can do
9350,1, luke you know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here
9351,1, han bring them on  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around
9352,1, threepio we found the computer outlet sir

9596,1, tarkin youre sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship  im taking an awful risk vader  this had better work
9597,1, han not a bad bit of rescuing huh  you know sometimes i even amaze myself
9598,1, leia that doesnt sound too hard  besides they let us go  its the only explanation for the ease of our escape
9599,1, han easy you call that easy
9600,1, leia their tracking us
9601,1, han not this ship sister
9602,1, leia at least the information in artoo is still intact
9603,1, han whats so important  whats he carrying
9604,1, leia the technical readouts of that battle station  i only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found  its not over yet
9605,1, han it is for me sister  look i aint in this for your revolution and im not in it for you princess  i expect to be well paid  im in it for the money
9606,1, leia you neednt worry about your reward  if money is all that you love then thats what youll receive
9607,1, leia your friend is quite a mercenary  i wonder if he really cares about anything or anyone

9610,1, han im trying not to kid
9611,1, luke good
9612,1, han still shes got a lot of spirit  i dont know what do you think  do you think a princess and a guy like me
9613,1, luke no
9614,1, willard youre safe  we had feared the worst
9615,1, willard when we heard about alderaan we were afraid that you were lost along with your father
9616,1, leia we dont have time for our sorrows commander  the battle station has surely tracked us hereits the only explanation for the ease of our escape  you must use the information in this r unit to plan the attack  it is our only hope
9617,1, tarkin yes
9618,1, death star intercom voice we are approaching the planet yavin  the rebel base is on a moon on the far side  we are preparing to orbit the planet
9619,1, dodonna the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleetits defenses are designed around a direct largescale assault  a small oneman fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense
9620,1, gold leader pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that
9621,1, dodonna well the empire doesnt consider a small oneman fighter to be any threat or theyd have a tighter defense  an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station
9622,1, dodonna the approach will not be easy  you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point  the target area is only two meters wide  its a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port  the shaft leads directly to the reactor system  a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station
9623,1, dodonna only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction  the shaft is rayshielded so youll have to use proton torpedoes
9624,1, wedge thats impossible even for a computer
9625,1, luke its not impossible  i used to bullseye womp rats in my tsixteen back home  theyre not much bigger than two meters
9626,1, dodonna man your ships  and may the force be with you
9627,1, death star intercom voice orbiting the planet at maximum velocity  the moon with the rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes
9628,1, vader this will be a day long remembered  it has seen the end of kenobi and it will soon see the end of the rebellion
9629,1, man all flight troops man your stations  all flight troops man your stations
9630,1, luke so you got your reward and youre just leaving then
9631,1, han thats right yeah  i got some old debts ive got to pay off with this stuff  even if i didnt you dont think id be fool enough to stick around here do you  why dont you come with us  youre pretty good in a fight  i could use you
9632,1, luke come on  why dont you take a look around  you know whats about to happen what theyre up against  they could use a good pilot like you  youre turning your back on them
9633,1, han what goods a reward if you aint around to use it  besides attacking that battle station aintmy idea of courage  its more like suicide
9634,1, luke all right  well take care of yourself han guess thats what youre best at isnt it
9635,1, han hey luke may the force be with you
9636,1, han whatre you lookin at  i know what im doing

10868,1, emperor patience my friend in time he will seek you out and when he does you must bring him before me he has grown strong only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force
10869,1, vader as you wish
10870,1, emperor everything is proceeding as i have foreseen
10871,1, yoda hmm that face you make look i so old to young eyes
10872,1, luke no of course not
10873,1, yoda i do yes i do  sick have i become old and weak  when nine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not hmm
10874,1, yoda soon will i rest yes forever sleep earned it i have
10875,1, luke master yoda you cant die
10876,1, yoda strong am i with the force but not that strong twilight is upon me and soon night must fall that is the way of things  the way of the force
10877,1, luke but i need your help ive come back to complete the training
10878,1, yoda no more training do you require already know you that which you need
10879,1, luke then i am a jedi
10880,1, yoda ohhh not yet one thing remains vader you must confront vader then only then a jedi will you be and confront him you will
10881,1, luke master yoda is darth vader my father
10882,1, yoda mmm rest i need yes rest
10883,1, luke yoda i must know
10884,1, yoda your father he is
10885,1, yoda told you did he
10886,1, luke yes
10887,1, yoda unexpected this is and unfortunate
10888,1, luke unfortunate that i know the truth
10889,1, yoda no unfortunate that you rushed to face him that incomplete was your training not ready for the burden were you
10890,1, luke well im sorry
10891,1, yoda remember a jedis strength flows from the force  but beware  anger fear aggression the dark side are they  once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny
10892,1, yoda lukelukedo notdo not underestimate the powers of the emperor or suffer your fathers fate you will luke when gone am i  the last of the jedi will you be luke the force runs strong in your family pass on what you have learned luke  there is anotherskyskywalker
10893,1, luke i cant do it artoo i cant go on alone
10894,1, ben yoda will always be with you
10895,1, luke obiwan why didnt you tell me
10896,1, luke you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father
10897,1, ben you father was seduced by the dark side of the force he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed so what i have told you was true from a certain point of view
10898,1, luke a certain point of view
10899,1, ben luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view
10900,1, ben i dont blame you for being angry if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time you see what happened to your father was my fault
10901,1, ben anakin was a good friend
10902,1, ben when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him  i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi  i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda  i was wrong  my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy
10903,1, luke theres still good in him
10904,1, ben i also thought he could be turned back to the good side it couldnt be done he is more machine now than man twisted and evil
10905,1, luke i cant do it ben
10906,1, ben you cannot escape your destiny
10907,1, luke i tried to stop him once i couldnt do it
10908,1, ben vader humbled you when first you met him lukebut that experience was part of your training it taught you among other things the value of patience  had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda you would have been prepared
10909,1, luke but i had to help my friends
10910,1, ben and did you help them it was they who had to save you you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear
10911,1, luke i found out darth vader was my father
10912,1, ben to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldnt get past impatience is the easiest door  for you like your father only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm youre no longer so reckless now luke you are strong and patient and now you must face darth vader again
10913,1, luke i cant kill my own father
10914,1, ben then the emperor has already won you were our only hope
10915,1, luke yoda spoke of another
10916,1, ben the other he spoke of is your twin sister
10917,1, luke but i have no sister
10918,1, ben hmm to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous
10919,1, luke leia leias my sister
10920,1, ben your insight serves you well bury your feelings deep down luke they do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor
10921,1, ben when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible  so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan
10922,1, ben the organa household was highborn and politically quite powerful in that system leia became a princess by virtue of lineage no one knew shed been adopted of course but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy  even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well  thats not all she became of course she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause  thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate
10923,1, luke but you cant let her get involved now ben vader will destroy her
10924,1, ben she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke  but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family there is no avoiding the battle you must face and destroy vader
10925,1, han well look at you a general huh
10926,1, lando oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab
10927,1, han well dont look at me pal i just said you were a fair pilot i didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack
10928,1, lando im surprised they didnt ask you to do it
10929,1, han well who says they didnt  but i aint crazy youre the respectable one remember
10930,1, mon mothma the emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come
10931,1, mon mothma the data brought to us by the bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the emperors new battle station we also know that the weapon systems of this death star are not yet operational with the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected but most important of all weve learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star
10932,1, mon mothma many bothans died to bring us this information admiral ackbar please
10933,1, ackbar you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational the death star does have a strong defense mechanism it is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor
10934,1, ackbar general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
10935,1, han good luck
10936,1, han youre gonna need it
10937,1, ackbar general madine
10938,1, general madine we have stolen a small imperial shuttle disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator
10939,1, threepio sounds dangerous
10940,1, leia i wonder who they found to pull that off
10941,1, general madine general solo is your strike team assembled
10942,1, han uh my teams ready i dont have a command crew for the shuttle

18037,1,general davits draven captain andor  s mission is to authenticate the pilot  s story and then if possible find your father

18312,1,galen erso saw if you  re watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the alliance perhaps there  s a chance to explain myself and though i don   dare hope for too much a chance for jyn if she  s alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately i  ve missed her jyn my stardust i can   imagine what you think of me when i was taken i faced some bitter truths i was told that soon enough krennic would have you as well as time went by i knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you i knew if i refused to work if i took my own life it would only be a matter of time before krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project so i did the one thing that nobody expected i lied i learned to lie i played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work i made myself indispensable and all the while i laid the groundwork of my revenge we call it the death star there is no better name and the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed i  ve placed a weakness deep within the system a flaw so small and powerful they  ll never find it but jyn jyn if you  re listening my beloved so much of my life has been wasted i try to think of you only in the moments when i  m strong because the pain of not having you with me your mother our family the pain of that loss is so overwhelming i risk failing even now it  s just so hard not to think of you think of where you are my stardust saw the reactor module that  s the key that  s the place i  ve laid my trap it  s well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station
18313,1,the death star blasts the holy city of jedha vaporising it in an instant
18314,1,galen erso you  ll need the plans the structural plans for the death star to find the reactor i know there  s a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the citadel tower on scarif any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station
18315,1,the hologram cuts off because of the earthquake going through the partisan base due to the death star  s fire jyn falls to her knees crying the partisans guarding the cells scream and scatter leaving the prisoners behind the three manage to break the lock and free themselves

19031,1,the mon cala cruiser has received the transmissions but someone catches a massive object on the horizon its the death star krennic opens his eyes and a look of horror flashes on his face as he sees it too
19032,1,lieutenant sir we  re detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace
19033,1,aboard the death sta stand tarkin and romodi ready to give the command to fire

19038,1,general hurst romodi commence primary ignition
19039,1,the death star control panels are ignited and the same green ray emerges from the reactor krennic watches silently as it fires destroying the antenna and hitting the ocean where a giant wave rises from the impact raddus watches the destruction from above
19040,1,admiral raddus rogue one may the force be with you all ships prepare for jump to hyperspace
19041,1,just before the fleet can make the jump the devastator jumps out of hyperspace and darth vader stands on the bridge as his isd destroys the remnants of the rebel fleet on the beach jyn and cassian hug as they fall ont othe sand and watch the wave come toward them
19042,1,jyn erso i  m glad you came
19043,1,cassian andor you father would have been proud of you jyn

19058,1,rebel it  s jammed
19059,1,vader slaughters the rebels easily and cold bloodedly despite all their efforts someone manages to pass on the plans to the outside before being impaled by his saber the survivors run to the tantive iv thats docked to the cruiser

19068,0,a black void
19069,0,we can hear movement strange skittering sounds like
19070,0,razorclaws on metal the hiss of pneumatic hoses
19071,0,the whirr and click of servos liquid gurgling an
19072,0,eerie alien cacophony
19073,0,earth
19074,0,appears hanging now in the starry blackness the
19075,0,alien noises continue and far in the distance we hear
19076,0,the muffled thump of what could be a distant explosion
19077,0,alien text suddenly appears next to earth and we
19078,0,reveal we are in
19079,0,int borg recon center
19080,0,the image of earth is actually on a monitor which is
19081,0,only one of dozens of monitors covering a huge wall
19082,0,we dont see anything of the rest of the room but the
19083,0,technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre
19084,0,a mixture of organic and mechanical elements
19085,0,circuitry and optical cabling are sidebyside with
19086,0,what looks almost like arteries and organs we can
19087,0,still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises
19088,0,occasionally a shadowy form sweeps past the camera
19089,0,vaguely humanoid but we cant tell who or what it is
19090,0,all of the monitors are active and they present myriad
19091,0,images and sound all related to earth history the
19092,0,screens show everything from written chinese to
19093,0,renaissance paintings to black and white newsreel
19094,0,footage of world war two to what look like clips of
19095,0,space battles from the th century the entire range
19096,0,of human history dancing across the monitors the
19097,0,effect is dizzying we get the feeling that whoever
19098,0,is watching this is studying the human race
19099,0,there is another thump and the wall of monitors
19100,0,shudders slightly we hear the voice of what we will
19101,0,come to know as the borg collective thousands of
19102,0,voices speaking at once

19104,0,restrict search parameters to
19105,0,through
19106,0,the images on the monitors now change to show us images
19107,0,from st century earth history
19108,0,again its a collection of still photography video
19109,0,footage text artwork etc we hear snippets of sound
19110,0,bites music speeches from the period a lot of
19111,0,enticing details as the images race across the
19112,0,monitors we should learn the following
19113,0,the turn of the st century brought chaos
19114,0,regional wars the collapse of the united nations
19115,0,societal breakdown crime starvation desperation
19116,0,a third world war nuclear explosions
19117,0,environmental disasters tens of millions dead the

19119,0,vanishes humanity teetering on the edge of the second
19120,0,dark age
19121,0,the image of a single man zephram cochrane a
19122,0,visionary scientist he see the spacecraft he created
19123,0,out of a nuclear missile he flies the first warp
19124,0,test breaking the light barrier it changes history
19125,0,grainy black and white images of a vulcan scout ship
19126,0,landing on earth they saw cochranes flight followed
19127,0,him back to earth and made first contact with the
19128,0,human race
19129,0,humanity turns the corner first contact with an
19130,0,alien civilization brings the planet together as never
19131,0,before humans and vulcans working together beginning
19132,0,to solve longstanding problems with new technology
19133,0,we see an early replicator producing food for the
19134,0,starving millions a new world government is formed
19135,0,people from planet earth and people from vulcan form
19136,0,an alliance they call it the united federation of
19137,0,planets and they commission a fleet of starships for
19138,0,protection and exploration they call it starfleet
19139,0,these are images recounting the birth of the star
19140,0,trek universe
19141,0,another muffled explosion this one stronger shakes
19142,0,the entire wall one of the monitors blows out in a
19143,0,shower of sparks and now a new voice a womans
19144,0,voice low threatening with a slight metallic

19149,0,another explosion rocks the room and it takes us to
19150,0,ext space a borg sphere
19151,0,a huge spherical borg warship as it takes a phaser
19152,0,shot from an unseen vessel the blast smashes into the
19153,0,borg sphere but the massive ship continues the
19154,0,sphere returns fire follow the borg fire to
19155,0,a federation starship
19156,0,locked in battle with the borg sphere the borg fire
19157,0,destroys the federation ship in a fiery blast
19158,0,new angle
19159,0,as the borg sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
19160,0,decimated starship and as it does we reveal that this
19161,0,is just one small part of
19162,0,a massive space battle
19163,0,involving dozens of starfleet and borg vessels engaged
19164,0,in a fierce firefight as far as the eye can see ships
19165,0,turning twisting firing exploding lots of movement
19166,0,its a spectacular sight
19167,0,the borg sphere is moving away from the battle heading
19168,0,off in another direction
19169,0,
19170,0,new angle
19171,0,in the middle of the battle a borg cube is attacking
19172,0,a smaller federation starship the starship is taking
19173,0,quite a beating explosions all along the hull it
19174,0,doesnt look like it can take much more of this
19175,0,suddenly a spread of four torpedoes come blazing in
19176,0,from oc the torpedoes slam into the borg ship
19177,0,causing massive damage
19178,0,the uss enterprise ncc e
19179,0,soars into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
19180,0,starship
19181,0,the enterprise is starfleets newest and most powerful
19182,0,vessel an elegant and majestic ship but unlike the
19183,0,last enterprise starfleet has opted for a more
19184,0,muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
19185,0,and other defensive armory we get the feeling this
19186,0,enterprise is ready for anything

19960,0,nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the borg
19961,0,attack from orbit there are large smoking craters
19962,0,all around part of the ground seems to have collapsed
19963,0,to a depth of ten feet like a sinkhole nearby picard

19965,0,geordi
19966,0,this must be it
19967,0,picard
19968,0,how serious is the damage
19969,0,geordi
19970,0,off tricorder
19971,0,im having trouble scanning

19974,0,picard
19975,0,probably from the nuclear warhead
19976,0,cochrane was planning to use it to
19977,0,ignite the warp drive
19978,0,as they speak beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
19979,0,everyone injections
19980,0,beverly
19981,0,this will protect us from the

19984,0,it
19985,0,geordi
19986,0,im picking up faint life signs
19987,0,twenty meters below
19988,0,picard
19989,0,there should be an access hatch
19990,0,nearby
19991,0,everyone spreads out looking for the hatch one of
19992,0,the guards lange finds it
19993,0,lange
19994,0,over here
19995,0,everyone rushes over to him theres a small hatch on

20002,0,picard
20003,0,i have the password right here
20004,0,picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back
20005,0,he aims and fires at the hatch which is blown open
20006,0,revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness
20007,0,as they start to crawl inside

20011,0,the underground room is filled with st century
20012,0,equipment consoles and monitors one entire wall of
20013,0,the room is dominated by a huge metal blast door which
20014,0,is now closed we will learn that on the other side of
20015,0,that door is the nuclear missilewarp ship itself
20016,0,the ceiling has partially collapsed chunks of
20017,0,concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
20018,0,equipmentonly a few of the consoles are active most
20019,0,are dark or fritzing sporadically the lights are out
20020,0,and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires
20021,0,four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room
20022,0,its a scene of destruction
20023,0,picard
20024,0,and his team enter the dark and smoking ruin beverly
20025,0,and picard move to one of the dead men while geordi
20026,0,and the security guards move to the other three
20027,0,beverly rolls the man onto his back hes clearly
20028,0,dead the name stitched on his uniform says rippert
20029,0,picard looks up
20030,0,picard
20031,0,to others
20032,0,see if any of these men are

20038,0,this ones a woman named kirby
20039,0,picard and beverly move toward the immense blast door
20040,0,as beverly scans it picard glances at a nearby desk
20041,0,
20042,0,the desk
20043,0,is littered with debris and various documents and
20044,0,schematics three photographs are pinned to a bulletin
20045,0,board above the desk they show zephram cochrane and
20046,0,two angles of his warp ship the photos are odd
20047,0,looking printed on what appears to be some sort of
20048,0,cloth
20049,0,beverly
20050,0,theres a life sign behind this

20057,0,picard
20058,0,there should be some kind of
20059,0,manual release
20060,0,they hunt around for a moment geordi runs his hand
20061,0,along the edge of the blast door picard turns to the
20062,0,guards
20063,0,picard
20064,0,to lange
20065,0,get those fires out and then try
20066,0,to restore main power to the

20068,0,lange
20069,0,aye sir
20070,0,the guards move off
20071,0,geordi
20072,0,got it captain
20073,0,geordi has found an emergency box with several
20074,0,pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
20075,0,emergency use only he pulls down the lever there
20076,0,is a hissing sound and the blast door slowly slides
20077,0,down into the floor we can now see the missile silo
20078,0,itself beyond the door picard geordi and beverly
20079,0,step into
20080,0,int missile silo continuous
20081,0,picard geordi and beverly step onto the catwalk which
20082,0,surrounds the silo walls in the middle is the warp
20083,0,ship itself it should look like an advanced icbm
20084,0,missile with a cockpit in place of the warhead and
20085,0,with numerous modifications to the fuselage the
20086,0,cockpit is on the same level as the control room on
20087,0,the side of the missile is the name phoenix the
20088,0,missile itself extends down another four stories
20089,0,there are other catwalks below this one with ladders
20090,0,connecting the different levels beverly sees
20091,0,something below
20092,0,beverly
20093,0,there
20094,0,new angle
20095,0,two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
20096,0,grating they all scramble down the ladders past the
20097,0,massive missile note because of the design of the
20098,0,silo we will see the entire missile only in a few
20099,0,shots for the most part our view is limited to
20100,0,sections of the missile

20105,0,geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
20106,0,their level the side panels have been removed
20107,0,revealing complex circuitry within
20108,0,picard joins beverly who turns over the injured man
20109,0,its zephram cochrane the man whose picture we saw
20110,0,on the borg monitors beverly begins pulling devices
20111,0,out of her medkit injects cochrane with a hypospray
20112,0,cochrane is a man in his midforties he has a

20115,0,picard
20116,0,its cochrane

20132,0,orient himself to the task at hand theres a lot at
20133,0,stake and a lot to do he turns to geordi
20134,0,picard
20135,0,mister la forge listen very

20142,0,geordi takes a deep breath its a tall order
20143,0,geordi
20144,0,id better get started
20145,0,geordi goes to work picard bends down and carefully

20176,0,beverly
20177,0,are you saying they wont help us
20178,0,picard
20179,0,im saying they might shoot us on

20184,0,beverly
20185,0,there must be some good people

20267,0,riker
20268,0,what the hell is happening worf
20269,0,worf
20270,0,off console
20271,0,it appears that someone has taken
20272,0,over the environmental control

20274,0,troi
20275,0,someone
20276,0,riker
20277,0,realizing
20278,0,the borg some of them mustve
20279,0,beamed over before we destroyed
20280,0,their ship
20281,0,to worf
20282,0,seal off that entire deck with
20283,0,emergency force fields
20284,0,troi
20285,0,wil data was down there
20286,0,riker
20287,0,to worf
20288,0,mister worf find data if you
20289,0,can but your top priority is
20290,0,isolating the borg
20291,0,worf
20292,0,understood
20293,0,worf heads for a turbolift off rikers disturbed
20294,0,expression
20295,0,cut to
20296,0,close on datas face
20297,0,his eyes are closed theres a beat then his eyes fly
20298,0,open and he looks around
20299,0,we pull back slightly revealing data is lying on some
20300,0,kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints
20301,0,he tenses his arm and tries to move but he is unable
20302,0,to break the restraints about two feet in front of
20303,0,his face is what appears to be a bulkhead there is a
20304,0,cacophony of strange background noise scratching
20305,0,hisses gurgling liquids odd alien hums
20306,0,suddenly the table begins to move it rotates and as
20307,0,it does so we realize that data has been hanging upside
20308,0,down staring at the floor its a disorienting moment
20309,0,as our perspective changes and data rotates upright
20310,0,datas pov
20311,0,as the table gyrates we reveal the room slowly and
20312,0,we realize were in
20313,0,
20314,0,int borg hive
20315,0,the environmental control room seen earlier has now
20316,0,been transformed into the innersanctum of the borg
20317,0,the room has a dark moist organic feel a tropical
20318,0,jungle of cybernetic equipment
20319,0,the borg are altering the room converting starfleet
20320,0,technology and materials into the living bio
20321,0,mechanical look of the borg we see one borg drone
20322,0,attach a small pod to a starfleet console and activate
20323,0,it the pod immediately sends out a complex web of
20324,0,borg technology which covers the starfleet console
20325,0,inside and out its like weeds overpowering a flower
20326,0,bed within seconds the console has been borgified
20327,0,the walls ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
20328,0,the alcoves that make up the borg collective borg
20329,0,drones are motionless in their alcoves cabling and
20330,0,other conduits connecting them to various equipment
20331,0,while other borg are moving about the room carrying
20332,0,out various modifications to the room at one point
20333,0,we see ensign porter hes been completely borgified
20334,0,his skin pale expression blank no hint of humanity
20335,0,left
20336,0,data
20337,0,still strapped to the table which is twisting and
20338,0,rotating giving him frightening new glimpses of the
20339,0,room a new image appears six borg drones are
20340,0,clustered together in one section of the room each
20341,0,with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
20342,0,connected to its face
20343,0,through the tubes we can see an exchange of fluid and
20344,0,energy pulsing back and forth some sort of bizarre
20345,0,feeding or renewal is going on the tubes all seem
20346,0,to lead toward the ceiling
20347,0,data is now horizontal on his back and the table locks
20348,0,into position a borg drone opens a panel on the side
20349,0,of datas head and begins connecting a thick bundle of
20350,0,optical cabling to it
20351,0,data
20352,0,to borg
20353,0,your efforts to assimilate me will
20354,0,be unsuccessful
20355,0,the borg ignores him activates a console and the
20356,0,cabling connected to datas head lights up with power
20357,0,theyre trying to connect him to the collective
20358,0,data thinks for a moment tilts his head slightly
20359,0,and then suddenly theres a shower of sparks from the
20360,0,cabling hes been connected to the lights on the
20361,0,cable go out data has thwarted their attempts
20362,0,data
20363,0,to borg
20364,0,it would appear that resistance is
20365,0,not always futile
20366,0,suddenly a new voice is heard echoing through the room
20367,0,a womans voice low seductive deadly
20368,0,womans voice
20369,0,brave words ive heard them
20370,0,before from thousands of species
20371,0,across thousands of worlds
20372,0,since long before you were
20373,0,created
20374,0,data looks up toward
20375,0,the ceiling
20376,0,a rustle of movemnet somewhere in the cybertangle
20377,0,almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds and
20378,0,for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a face unlike
20379,0,any borg weve ever seen the face of a woman pale
20380,0,skinned piercing eyesraven hair slicked back
20381,0,a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
20382,0,technology and then its gone
20383,0,data
20384,0,frowns he saw it too but hes not sure what to make
20385,0,of it
20386,0,womans voice
20387,0,but now they are all one with
20388,0,the borg
20389,0,data
20390,0,i am unlike any lifeform you have
20391,0,encountered before as an
20392,0,android i am in complete control
20393,0,of my neural net the information
20394,0,contained there cannot be forcibly
20395,0,removed
20396,0,womans voice
20397,0,you are an imperfect being
20398,0,created by an imperfect being
20399,0,finding your weakness is only a
20400,0,matter of time
20401,0,suddenly three borg drones converge on data with
20402,0,various wickedlooking borg devices one of the borg
20403,0,has a specialized cybernetic arm which extrudes a
20404,0,series of stilettotipped drill spikes as the six
20405,0,inch spikes begin to bore into datas head
20406,0,cut to
20407,0,ext montana resurrection city day
20408,0,resurrection is a small town around people
20409,0,a rural western community thats probably existed for
20410,0,at least two hundred years and we can see the roots of
20411,0,the original ranching community in some of the
20412,0,architecture but its also a community of the st
20413,0,century
20414,0,the most striking feature of the town is that it sits
20415,0,in the middle of nearly a hundred wind mills which
20416,0,provide the only source of power for the town the
20417,0,blades are enormous but the structures supporting them
20418,0,are little more than simple poles some are sleek
20419,0,fiberglass futuristic others have a more cobbled
20420,0,together makeshift appearance at the moment only
20421,0,a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze
20422,0,picard and beverly emerge from the nearby woods
20423,0,carrying the stretcher they exchange a look at the
20424,0,sight of the city and then head toward it
20425,0,ext resurrection city day
20426,0,a few minutes later picard and beverly carrying
20427,0,cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
20428,0,end as they walk along we get our first taste of
20429,0,postapocalyptic st century life
20430,0,this is a recognizable american community but its
20431,0,definitely a futuristic town clothing architecture
20432,0,technology all have changed over the course of
20433,0,seventy years but it is a broken future what used
20434,0,to be hightech public computer terminals are rusted
20435,0,and abandoned we can see the corroded hulks of hover
20436,0,cars lying idle in the streets futuristic elements
20437,0,now useless
20438,0,at one point they pass a large polyurethane tent
20439,0,the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
20440,0,can see the silhouettes of people moving within the
20441,0,entrance is guarded by a single militia guard later
20442,0,we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse the
20443,0,only place where they can grow uncontaminated food
20444,0,what used to be a mcdonalds or some other
20445,0,recognizable food chain has now been gutted and has
20446,0,been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop people are
20447,0,fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
20448,0,tongs
20449,0,the sidewalks are populated with people who congregate
20450,0,in small groups quietly talking amongst themselves
20451,0,others just staring vacantly off into space many of
20452,0,them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies
20453,0,victims of the war and postnuclear environmental
20454,0,dangers a few of them are applying a special lotion
20455,0,to their arms and face protection against the toxic
20456,0,elements a long food line snakes around a block as
20457,0,people line up to get their daily rations
20458,0,a few people glance up at picard and beverly with
20459,0,curious or suspicious looks this is not a community
20460,0,that welcomes strangers at one point they see a man
20461,0,dressed in futuristic camouflage carrying an automatic
20462,0,weapon we will learn hes a militia soldier he
20463,0,stares at them with a neutral expression then walks
20464,0,off
20465,0,the people here have that holloweyed listless look
20466,0,about them theyre going through something that makes
20467,0,the great depression look like a minor inconvenience
20468,0,but theres also a toughness to these people a
20469,0,resilience and determination to survive in the face of
20470,0,overwhelming odds we are looking at our future and
20471,0,its on the verge of collapse
20472,0,cut to
20473,0,int hospital emergency room day
20474,0,a short time later cochrane is being lifted onto an
20475,0,operating table picard and beverly step back from the
20476,0,table as a doctor and two nurses look him over the
20477,0,doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered
20478,0,tired look to him the hospital itself is like the
20479,0,rest of the town a futuristic setting fallen on hard
20480,0,times the light in the room is provided mostly from
20481,0,the sunlight streaming in through the windows light
20482,0,bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital
20483,0,we get the feeling they have very little power
20484,0,doctor
20485,0,how long has he been unconscious
20486,0,beverly
20487,0,at least four hours
20488,0,he checks cochrans head injury as beverly takes out
20489,0,her tricorder and scans him
20490,0,doctor
20491,0,it looks like he has a cranial
20492,0,fracture but ill need xrays to

20589,0,the back of the building picard rushes out and spots
20590,0,an old dilapidated battery unit providing power to the
20591,0,hospital he quickly yanks off the back panel
20592,0,revealing a tangle of wires and several large

20645,0,cochranes bed a striking woman in her midtolate
20646,0,thirties dark hair tall lean beautiful under
20647,0,normal circumstances but at the moment shes not at her
20648,0,best it looks like shes just come in from a hard
20649,0,days work shes wearing an old lab coat but the
20650,0,most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
20651,0,we can see in her eyes
20652,0,shes looking directly at picard for an answer picard
20653,0,realizes he has to say something he looks into her
20654,0,eyes and there is a moment here a brief spark of
20655,0,chemistry that in normal circumstances the captain just
20656,0,might follow up but at the moment he shoves that
20657,0,electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer
20658,0,picard
20659,0,there was some kind of explosion
20660,0,out at the missile silo
20661,0,she looks at him for a moment her eyes boring into him
20662,0,without expression as though probing the truthfulness
20663,0,of his statement
20664,0,doctor
20665,0,ruby were going to need a series

20718,0,ahead he happens to glance down a side street then
20719,0,he stops
20720,0,new angle
20721,0,looking down the side street ruby the mysterious
20722,0,woman from the hospital is walking along with a camera
20723,0,bag now slung over her shoulder she stops for a
20724,0,moment as she passes the hulk of a burntout old hover
20725,0,car stares at itthen pulls a homemade
20726,0,futuristic camera out of her bag and snaps a picture of
20727,0,the car she continues on her way picard is

20735,0,scrimm scrimm is the head of the towns militia
20736,0,while not a physically threatening man there is a
20737,0,quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
20738,0,intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility
20739,0,hes wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
20740,0,carries a sidearm before the war scrimm was probably
20741,0,one of the survivalists who used to be dismissed as
20742,0,radicals until their predictions of armageddon came
20743,0,true at the moment scrimm is presenting his
20744,0,friendliest face to picard
20745,0,scrimm
20746,0,pleasant
20747,0,think youll need that
20748,0,picard eyes the canister not sure what to make of it

20774,0,picard
20775,0,i was raised in england and here
20776,0,in the states thank you for
20777,0,the no zone
20778,0,picard begins to walk away not wanting to engage any
20779,0,citizens of the town scrimm falls in next to him
20780,0,scrimm
20781,0,where in the states
20782,0,picard
20783,0,oh here and there you know
20784,0,how it is

20788,0,right here never had much use
20789,0,for travel
20790,0,he casually steps in front of picard blocking his way
20791,0,scrimm
20792,0,where are you from most recently
20793,0,picard
20794,0,thinking fast
20795,0,california san francisco

20797,0,beautiful city used to be
20798,0,anyway i didnt think anyone
20799,0,still lived there
20800,0,picard
20801,0,theres a few of us left
20802,0,picard steps around him and continues walking down the
20803,0,street scrimm waits a beat then walks after him
20804,0,again
20805,0,scrimm
20806,0,that was a pretty clever trick you
20807,0,did with the hospitals batteries
20808,0,howd you do it
20809,0,picard
20810,0,it wasnt a trick i used to be
20811,0,an electrical engineer
20812,0,scrimm
20813,0,huh
20814,0,he steps in front of picard again still pleasant but
20815,0,a little bit of a smile fading from his face picard
20816,0,realizes he isnt going to shake this man so easily
20817,0,scrimm
20818,0,and what were you doing out at the
20819,0,missile silo
20820,0,picard
20821,0,im an old friend of cochranes
20822,0,i wanted to see how he was doing
20823,0,scrimm
20824,0,lucky for him you came by when you
20825,0,did he might be dead now
20826,0,picard
20827,0,yes
20828,0,scrimm
20829,0,maybe you can tell me what hes
20830,0,been doing in that silo we heard
20831,0,some explosions out there this
20832,0,morning
20833,0,picard
20834,0,i think he was running a test on
20835,0,an old rocket engine and one of
20836,0,the fuel cells burst
20837,0,scrimm eyes him evenly
20838,0,scrimm
20839,0,you seem to have an answer for
20840,0,everything
20841,0,picard
20842,0,something wrong with that
20843,0,scrimm
20844,0,not yet
20845,0,a tense beat then scrimm smiles easily
20846,0,scrimm
20847,0,re balm
20848,0,be sure you put that on you need
20849,0,a lot of protection around here
20850,0,he holds picards eyes for a moment
20851,0,picard
20852,0,thank you but ive never had
20853,0,much trouble protecting myself
20854,0,now its picards turn to smile pleasantly at scrimm
20855,0,picard walks around him and heads for the gates
20856,0,scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression
20857,0,clearly hes more than a little suspicious
20858,0,cut to
20859,0,ext space the enterprise
20860,0,in orbit of earth
20861,0,int corridor
20862,0,worf and a large security detachment a dozen or so
20863,0,men and women are moving down the corridor with grim
20864,0,looks on their faces they are carrying new powerful
20865,0,looking phaser rifles and other equipment the feeling
20866,0,is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
20867,0,mission they stop at one point and worf lifts up a
20868,0,deckplate exposing a large hatch in the floor worf
20869,0,hits his combadge
20870,0,worf
20871,0,worf to bridge were in
20872,0,position
20873,0,int bridge
20874,0,riker in command troi nearby riker is standing at
20875,0,the security station looking at a monitor which
20876,0,displays a schematic graphic of the ship the position
20877,0,of the security team is flashing we can see they are
20878,0,on deck
20879,0,riker
20880,0,this is the bridge im releasing
20881,0,the emergency force fields
20882,0,he nods to troi who works a console
20883,0,int corridor
20884,0,worf and his team watch as the forcefield protecting
20885,0,the hatch flashes off worf reaches down and releases
20886,0,the hatch which slides open with a soft whoosh he
20887,0,glances at his men for a moment then jumps down the
20888,0,hatch
20889,0,int deck corridor
20890,0,as worf lands on his feet the light is dim no power
20891,0,on this deck hard to see he looks around warily for
20892,0,a moment phaser attheready then activates his wrist
20893,0,beacon we immediately notice that we can see worfs
20894,0,breath its freezing cold down here he shines the
20895,0,light around the darkened corridor then silently
20896,0,motions his arm for the others to follow a beat then
20897,0,we see the security officers start to drop into the
20898,0,corridor from the hatch above
20899,0,new angle corridor
20900,0,as worfs squad spreads out along the hall weapons at
20901,0,theready everyone alert with fingers on the triggers
20902,0,we see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
20903,0,own light sources intended to illuminate the target
20904,0,before you shoot at it the security officers are
20905,0,constantly moving their lights back and forth through
20906,0,the chilly air worf gives hand signals holds up
20907,0,two fingers then a fist and points forward
20908,0,two guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet
20909,0,stop and take up firing positions then two more
20910,0,members of the team run down leap frog ahead of them
20911,0,and take positions further down the corridor classic
20912,0,military deployment worf starts scanning with a
20913,0,tricorder
20914,0,worf
20915,0,hits combadge
20916,0,worf to bridge
20917,0,rikers com voice
20918,0,riker here
20919,0,worf
20920,0,theres a dampening field in place
20921,0,on this deck our tricorders are
20922,0,useless
20923,0,the team continue to explore deck its spooky
20924,0,eerie a sense of menace around every corner they
20925,0,open doors check room by room section by section
20926,0,still no sign of the borg in the freezing cold
20927,0,darkness
20928,0,angle on security guard
20929,0,the corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall
20930,0,ceiling and deck panels all the normal decorative
20931,0,enterprise sheathing is gone revealing the circuitry
20932,0,and machinery of the ship itself unlike the rest of
20933,0,the corridors there does appear to be power flowing
20934,0,through some of the conduits up ahead and it gives off
20935,0,an eerie glow
20936,0,we can also see that some of the machinery has been
20937,0,altered and changed not just the neat and orderly
20938,0,arrangement youd expect to find behind bulkheads
20939,0,theres a sense of crosscircuitry rewiring
20940,0,equipment being rearranged clearly a lot of work has
20941,0,gone on in this area of the ship worf steps forward
20942,0,examines the corridor closely
20943,0,ensign hawk
20944,0,what the hell is going on
20945,0,worf
20946,0,borg
20947,0,worf signals the team forward and they slowly begin
20948,0,picking their way down the borgified corridor its
20949,0,not easy they have to choose their footing carefully
20950,0,as they walk through the maze of cables circuits and
20951,0,machinery ensign hawk accidentally steps on some
20952,0,circuitry which gives off a beep the entire team
20953,0,suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
20954,0,unfortunate ensign who pales at their sudden attention
20955,0,worf looks irritated then motions his team to continue
20956,0,their search they continue making their way down the
20957,0,spooky corridor and as they turn a corner
20958,0,new angle another corridor
20959,0,where the machinery is now thicker and more borglike
20960,0,in appearance tubes and cabling hang down from the
20961,0,ceiling if anything its even colder in here the
20962,0,deeper they go the worse it gets we can now hear a
20963,0,low sinister hum of alien power at the end of this
20964,0,corridor is the enviromental control room as seen
20965,0,earlier the entire doorway is gone and a weird
20966,0,pulsing glow fills the room worf stops his team at
20967,0,the sight from this vantage we cannot see directly
20968,0,into the room but clearly something is going on in
20969,0,there
20970,0,worf signals his men to spread out and they take up
20971,0,positions around the corridor all weapons trained on
20972,0,environmental control
20973,0,worf
20974,0,worf to bridge were about to
20975,0,enter the environmental control
20976,0,room
20977,0,rikers com voice
20978,0,any sign of data or the borg
20979,0,themselves
20980,0,as work and riker continue talking we move to ensign
20981,0,hawk who is now the last man in the formation
20982,0,covering the rear hes shining his phaserbeacon into
20983,0,the empty darkness he cant help looking back over
20984,0,his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
20985,0,environmental control room that seems to be where
20986,0,the action is as he turns his beacon moves with him
20987,0,throwing the corridor behind them in and out of
20988,0,darkness
20989,0,worf
20990,0,continuing
20991,0,negative however theyve
20992,0,reconfigured the odn network
20993,0,and rerouted all power on this
20994,0,deck into environmental control
20995,0,as worf speaks ensign hawk turns back but this time
20996,0,when he shines his beacon into the darkness something
20997,0,moves in the distance a shadow the ensign freezes
20998,0,brings his rifle up but did he see it or was it his
20999,0,imagination
21000,0,a tense beat as he waits heart pounding but nothing
21001,0,happens on the wall next to his head we see what can
21002,0,only be described as a biomechanistic cable creeping
21003,0,out of the wall which begins slowly heading for the
21004,0,ensigns neck just as he begins to sense that
21005,0,something is happening behind him the cable whips out
21006,0,around his neck and yanks him deep into the bed of
21007,0,circuitry in the blink of an eye the motion so fast
21008,0,we have trouble following it
21009,0,worf turns his head at the sound
21010,0,worf
21011,0,stand by commander
21012,0,to team
21013,0,wheres ensign hawk
21014,0,everyone looks around surprised that hes not there
21015,0,everyone is alert keyed up the tension is thick
21016,0,utter silence except for the hum of the machinery and
21017,0,the frosty breathing of the team
21018,0,rikers com voice
21019,0,worf is something wrong
21020,0,worf
21021,0,something is very wrong
21022,0,commander were falling back
21023,0,worf gives hand signals for the team to move out but
21024,0,just as they start to fall back everything happens at
21025,0,once
21026,0,borg drones
21027,0,explode out of the walls ceiling and floor what
21028,0,follows is a blur of action happening so fast and
21029,0,furious we never get a true sense of whats happening
21030,0,a flurry of violence and motion and images
21031,0,a snarling borg face halfhuman halfmachine a
21032,0,cybernetic nightmare
21033,0,strange biomechanical weapons extruding from borg
21034,0,bodies ripping into human flesh
21035,0,a crewmember pulled into a bed of machinery
21036,0,worf
21037,0,fire at will
21038,0,but the borg are already on top of them its a brutal
21039,0,fight in close quarters with no escape
21040,0,phasers and borg lasers lighting up the corridor
21041,0,bodies flying through the air utter chaos and
21042,0,terror the fight goes hand to hand and worf sees that
21043,0,they dont have a chance
21044,0,worf
21045,0,throwing off a borg
21046,0,fall back
21047,0,the team starts backpedaling firing as they gobut
21048,0,the borg are unstoppable now they put up personal
21049,0,force fields to protect themselves
21050,0,worf
21051,0,go go go
21052,0,worf pushes his men down the corridor everyone turns
21053,0,and runs like hell worf bends down and grabs a
21054,0,frightened lieutenant by the collar pulling him along
21055,0,various shots
21056,0,the team running through the corridors shooting
21057,0,behind them at the pursuing borg to no effect
21058,0,two of the borg raise their arms and fire laser
21059,0,bursts out of their arms and wrists taking down two
21060,0,security guards worf sees them fall but theres no
21061,0,time to go back
21062,0,int deck corridor
21063,0,as worfs team starts climbing up and out the dark
21064,0,hatch in the floor seen earlier
21065,0,
21066,0,int deck corridor
21067,0,as the last member of worfs team climbs out to safety
21068,0,the borg swarm is about to overpower worf he quickly
21069,0,hits a few controls on his phaser sets it to overload
21070,0,we hear the building whine he jumps straight up into
21071,0,the air grabbing onto the hatch rim pulling himself
21072,0,up he barely manages to vanish from view just as the
21073,0,phaser explodes in a fiery blast taking out several of
21074,0,the borg drones
21075,0,int deck corridor
21076,0,the conclusive blast comes up through the hatch
21077,0,causing worf to duck for a moment
21078,0,worf reaches out to close the hatch when a borg hand
21079,0,bursts up from below and grabs his forearm its a
21080,0,test of strength worf reaches over with his other
21081,0,arm hits a control and the hatch slides closed
21082,0,severing the borg arm in a shower of sparks
21083,0,worf
21084,0,worf to bridge force fields
21085,0,the force field flashes into place worf and his team
21086,0,sit there a moment catching their breath stunned at
21087,0,what theyve just been through
21088,0,rikers com voice
21089,0,what the hell happened down there
21090,0,worf
21091,0,worf
21092,0,commander we have a problem
21093,0,
21094,0,off worfs shaken expression
21095,0,cut to
21096,0,int missile silo catwalk day
21097,0,geordi and picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
21098,0,toward the missiles massive engines now that the
21099,0,smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
21100,0,bit we get our first good look at the ship and the
21101,0,damage done in the borg attack
21102,0,geordi
21103,0,on the move
21104,0,cochrane was going to use this
21105,0,solid rocket booster to lift the
21106,0,ship into orbit before the warp
21107,0,drive took over everything
21108,0,would depend on these old chemical
21109,0,engines
21110,0,beat
21111,0,now heres the problem
21112,0,they arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
21113,0,a large section of the engines have been blasted away
21114,0,leaving a deep ugly scar broken conduit lines
21115,0,wires that now lead to nothing its clear that a key
21116,0,piece of equipment has been destroyed
21117,0,geordi
21118,0,re damage
21119,0,this used to be the throttle valve
21120,0,assembly
21121,0,observing it
21122,0,it controls the thrust of the
21123,0,engines its been completely
21124,0,vaporized and without it
21125,0,theres no way to launch the ship
21126,0,picard
21127,0,can you reconstruct the throttle
21128,0,valve
21129,0,geordi
21130,0,yeah if i knew what it looked
21131,0,like theres probably five
21132,0,hundred ways to design a valve
21133,0,like this
21134,0,picard
21135,0,we need to launch this ship in
21136,0,under eighteen hours
21137,0,beat
21138,0,there must be some design
21139,0,schematics blueprints
21140,0,geordi
21141,0,were tearing this place apart
21142,0,looking for them but the
21143,0,computers are down and the fires
21144,0,destroyed half the filesso
21145,0,far nothing
21146,0,they look at the damage in frustration
21147,0,geordi
21148,0,if it was just part of the warp
21149,0,drive id know what to do but
21150,0,this its like trying to
21151,0,rebuild orville wrights airplane
21152,0,with canvass and sticks
21153,0,picard thinks remembers something
21154,0,picard
21155,0,wait a minute
21156,0,int control room
21157,0,moments later picard and geordi are looking at the
21158,0,three clothprinted photographs seen earlier the
21159,0,headshot of cochrane and two different angles of the
21160,0,three clothprinted photographs seen earlier the
21161,0,warp ship with people working on it picard spreads
21162,0,them out on the desk
21163,0,geordi
21164,0,yeah i looked at these already
21165,0,geordi points to a photo of the ship a worker is
21166,0,walking in front of the throttle assembly blocking
21167,0,most of it from view
21168,0,geordi
21169,0,you can almost see the throttle
21170,0,assembly in this one but this
21171,0,guy walked in front of it when
21172,0,they took the picture
21173,0,picard considers absently sticks his hand in his
21174,0,jacket pocket he pulls out the canister of balm
21175,0,scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table
21176,0,picard
21177,0,could you reconstruct the throttle
21178,0,from a photograph like this if
21179,0,that man wasnt blocking the view
21180,0,geordi thinks it over
21181,0,geordi
21182,0,maybe
21183,0,beat
21184,0,sure yeah as long as i could
21185,0,get a clear look at the intake
21186,0,configuration but so far we
21187,0,havent found any other photos
21188,0,picard
21189,0,staring at photos
21190,0,if there are other photographs
21191,0,i think i may know how to find
21192,0,them
21193,0,cut to
21194,0,int borg hive
21195,0,its a while later and the borg are making progress
21196,0,data is strapped to the table panels open on his head
21197,0,and chest three borg drones are working methodically
21198,0,on his innercircuitry the jagged voice of the woman
21199,0,cuts in
21200,0,womans voice
21201,0,your resistance is illogical
21202,0,to us your neural net is simply
21203,0,another piece of technology we
21204,0,will learn its secrets
21205,0,data stares at the murky ceiling
21206,0,data
21207,0,who are you
21208,0,womans voice
21209,0,i am the borg
21210,0,data
21211,0,that is a contradiction the borg
21212,0,act as a collective consciousness
21213,0,there are no individuals
21214,0,womans voice
21215,0,i am the beginning the end i
21216,0,am the one who is many i am the
21217,0,borg
21218,0,out of the mist that hugs the top of the room descends
21219,0,the borg queen
21220,0,she is unlike any of the borg drones weve ever seen
21221,0,a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
21222,0,of her body she has no legs her torso is suspended
21223,0,by a complex rig of cables and hydraulics her face
21224,0,and uppertorso are much more humanoid with the pasty
21225,0,pale white of borg flesh her eyes have a silvery
21226,0,glint to them her demeanor is seductive and sensual
21227,0,in contrast to the harsh mechanical surroundings she
21228,0,is an eerie blend of two worlds organic and
21229,0,mechanical
21230,0,with the soft hiss of hydraulics she lowers herself
21231,0,down to where her face is very close to that of datas
21232,0,her features are almost angelic but the silvery glint
21233,0,in her eyes betrays an innerdarkness
21234,0,data
21235,0,you are the guiding intelligence
21236,0,behind the borg
21237,0,borg queen
21238,0,intelligence ambition
21239,0,desire i bring order to
21240,0,chaos
21241,0,she studies his face with a certain childlike quality
21242,0,borg queen
21243,0,its unfortunate we will have to
21244,0,destroy you to obtain the
21245,0,information we need you are a
21246,0,unique lifeform
21247,0,beat
21248,0,synthetic and yet far more than
21249,0,a simple automaton
21250,0,you have no idea how close to
21251,0,perfection you are
21252,0,
21253,0,she stares at him intently and we get the hint that
21254,0,her interest in data may go beyond simple assimilation
21255,0,she seems fascinated by him data picks up on this
21256,0,data
21257,0,how do you define perfection
21258,0,the queen opens her arms slightly clearly indicating
21259,0,herself
21260,0,borg queen
21261,0,a blending of the organic and the
21262,0,synthetic the highest form of
21263,0,life in the galaxy
21264,0,data eyes her considering
21265,0,data
21266,0,an interesting definition but it
21267,0,is not one that applies to me i
21268,0,am completely artificial i have
21269,0,no organic components
21270,0,she looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind
21271,0,she mightve just found the chink in datas armor
21272,0,borg queen
21273,0,have you ever wondered what its
21274,0,like to have flesh
21275,0,data
21276,0,it is impossible to imagine
21277,0,sensations for which i have no
21278,0,frame of reference
21279,0,
21280,0,she smiles
21281,0,borg queen
21282,0,that can change
21283,0,the queen looks to the three borg drones and gives them
21284,0,a silent command the drones immediately stop working
21285,0,on datas open panels and shift their attention to
21286,0,his right arm one of the drones tears off the sleeve
21287,0,on datas uniform exposing his bare arm another then
21288,0,uses a small cutting device to slice off the synthetic
21289,0,skin from datas arm as data prepares himself for the
21290,0,worst
21291,0,int enterprise corridor
21292,0,three armored security guards with phaser rifles run
21293,0,into view hit a control panel on the wall a giant
21294,0,emergency bulkhead comes slamming down cutting off the
21295,0,rest of the corridor
21296,0,the security guards turn to run down the hall but then
21297,0,there is a highpitched shriek of wrenching metal
21298,0,they drop to the deck and take combat stances
21299,0,guard
21300,0,set phasers to rotating
21301,0,modulation
21302,0,they make adjustments to their weapons just as the
21303,0,bulkhead doors explode inward in a blinding flash the
21304,0,guards shield themselves against the fire and debris
21305,0,looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
21306,0,shapes of the borg jumping through the smashed
21307,0,bulkhead racing down the corridor toward them the
21308,0,guards fire and when they do the phaser blasts
21309,0,alternate color red blue green purple orange
21310,0,a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency
21311,0,the phaser blasts take down a few of the borg but
21312,0,then we see the distinctive personal forcefields of the
21313,0,other borg begin to compensate and the phasers no
21314,0,longer affect them
21315,0,guard
21316,0,thats it theyve adjusted
21317,0,fall back
21318,0,they turn to run but borg phaser fire lances out from
21319,0,the borg soldiers and rips them apart
21320,0,cut to
21321,0,int bridge
21322,0,the mood is tense grim riker worf and troi are
21323,0,gathered around a schematic of the enterprise the
21324,0,lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by
21325,0,the color red representing the borg advance through
21326,0,the ship a they watch another section of
21327,0,compartments and corridors suddenly turn red
21328,0,riker lets out a wary breath starts pointing to
21329,0,various points along the schematic
21330,0,riker
21331,0,all right weve lost control of
21332,0,eight decks three cargo bays
21333,0,one shuttlebay
21334,0,troi
21335,0,do we have any idea how many borg
21336,0,were dealing with
21337,0,worf
21338,0,we saw at least thirtyand
21339,0,there are twentytwo enterprise
21340,0,crewmembers reported missing
21341,0,including commander data
21342,0,
21343,0,riker
21344,0,well have to assume theyve been
21345,0,assimilated into the collective
21346,0,troi
21347,0,even data
21348,0,worf
21349,0,datas positronic net contains
21350,0,classified information on the
21351,0,enterprise command codes
21352,0,security protocols
21353,0,riker
21354,0,if they control data they control
21355,0,the ship
21356,0,a grim beat
21357,0,riker
21358,0,we cant worry about that right
21359,0,now lets concentrate on what we
21360,0,can
21361,0,they stare at the schematic
21362,0,worf
21363,0,to control the enterprise theyll
21364,0,have to gain access to one of two
21365,0,locations main engineering or
21366,0,the bridge
21367,0,riker
21368,0,we have to cover both
21369,0,possibilities
21370,0,to troi
21371,0,well take care of the bridge
21372,0,worf take your men and seal off
21373,0,main engineering turn it into a
21374,0,fortress nothing gets in
21375,0,worf nods and exits as riker and troi exchange a
21376,0,tense look
21377,0,cut to
21378,0,ext resurrection city hospital night
21379,0,the hospital is completely lit up the only building
21380,0,in town with this much power
21381,0,int hospital corridor night
21382,0,picard walks down the hall stops outside a door marked
21383,0,xray processing the red light is on above the
21384,0,door but that means nothing to picard who opens the
21385,0,door and steps inside
21386,0,
21387,0,int xray processing room
21388,0,much like a traditional darkroom trays of chemicals
21389,0,and washes etc but everything has a slightly
21390,0,futuristic and cobbledtogether feel they are
21391,0,developing xrays by hand instead of by machine the
21392,0,room is lit with an amber glow as soon as picard
21393,0,opens the door we hear rubys voice
21394,0,rubys voice
21395,0,shut that door
21396,0,picard quickly shuts the door behind him looks around
21397,0,the room ruby whos working at a tray of chemicals
21398,0,turns around in fury
21399,0,ruby
21400,0,what are you an idiot didnt
21401,0,you see the red light was on
21402,0,picard
21403,0,ah yes but i didnt realize
21404,0,that
21405,0,ruby
21406,0,thank god this plate was already
21407,0,fixed
21408,0,she pulls down a small pane of glass probably from a
21409,0,window out of a tub of water holds it up to the
21410,0,light and there on the glass is a xray of a mans
21411,0,skull picard moves to her
21412,0,picard
21413,0,re xray
21414,0,cochrane
21415,0,ruby
21416,0,yes and i only had enough
21417,0,silver halide for one shot so
21418,0,youre lucky you didnt screw it
21419,0,up
21420,0,picard
21421,0,im very sorry
21422,0,she glances at him sees he feels genuinely bad she
21423,0,softens a little
21424,0,ruby
21425,0,dont worry about it
21426,0,she picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
21427,0,dry off the pane of glass
21428,0,
21429,0,ruby
21430,0,did you need something
21431,0,picard
21432,0,yes i wanted to ask you about
21433,0,some photographs i saw out at the
21434,0,silo there were three of them
21435,0,printed on some kind of fabric
21436,0,ruby
21437,0,bed sheets
21438,0,off his look
21439,0,i used my last set of bed sheets to
21440,0,make those prints not the best
21441,0,material but i havent seen a
21442,0,clean piece of paper in five
21443,0,years
21444,0,picard
21445,0,did you take any other pictures of
21446,0,the rocket
21447,0,the xray is now dry and ruby turns and looks at him
21448,0,ruby
21449,0,sure
21450,0,jokingly
21451,0,why did you want to buy them
21452,0,picard doesnt realize she was kidding jumps on the
21453,0,opportunity to get the photos
21454,0,picard
21455,0,yes i dont have any money right
21456,0,now but i may be able to get
21457,0,some
21458,0,ruby looks at him for a moment is he serious she
21459,0,gives him a curious smile
21460,0,ruby
21461,0,money so you can get dome
21462,0,money
21463,0,picard
21464,0,i can try
21465,0,
21466,0,ruby
21467,0,youd have to try real hard no
21468,0,ones used currency in over ten
21469,0,years what are you from another
21470,0,planet
21471,0,
21472,0,picard hesitates smiles at her tries to laugh it off
21473,0,picard
21474,0,no but sometimes i feel that
21475,0,way
21476,0,beat
21477,0,what i meant was id be willing
21478,0,to trade for the photographs
21479,0,ruby
21480,0,trade okay the photographs
21481,0,for a straight answer
21482,0,beat
21483,0,who are you and how do you know
21484,0,zephram
21485,0,picard
21486,0,im an old friend i met him
21487,0,when he was doing his
21488,0,undergraduate work at cornell back
21489,0,in
21490,0,ruby
21491,0,cuts him off
21492,0,fraid not
21493,0,ruby walks past him with the xray
21494,0,int hospital corridor continuous
21495,0,picard follows ruby out into the corridor she has a
21496,0,satisfied smile on her face its not easy to put one
21497,0,over on this woman and the truth is shes enjoying
21498,0,picards frustration as they walk along
21499,0,picard
21500,0,what
21501,0,ruby
21502,0,casual
21503,0,youre lying
21504,0,picard
21505,0,what makes you say that
21506,0,ruby
21507,0,youre not someone who lies very
21508,0,easily so its obvious when you
21509,0,do at least to me
21510,0,picard
21511,0,are you always sucha good judge
21512,0,of character
21513,0,she stops turns looks at him
21514,0,ruby
21515,0,always
21516,0,ruby turns and walks off picard follows her doggedly
21517,0,determined to get those photos
21518,0,int hospital emergency room night
21519,0,beverly is holding the xray glass ruby made up to the
21520,0,light as the doctor seen earlier looks on
21521,0,beverly
21522,0,the occipital fracture is
21523,0,widening were going to have
21524,0,to fuse the bones
21525,0,doctor
21526,0,im a little worried about some of
21527,0,these bone fragments if they
21528,0,move any closer to the brain we
21529,0,could be looking at a hemorrhage
21530,0,as beverly and the doctor examine the xray we move to
21531,0,ruby whos looking down at cochrane hes still in
21532,0,bed and on a respirator she smoothes his hair with
21533,0,affection picard stands on the other side of the bed
21534,0,watching her
21535,0,picard
21536,0,were the two of you involved
21537,0,ruby
21538,0,no not like you and doctor
21539,0,crusher used to be
21540,0,picard
21541,0,surprised
21542,0,how did you know about that
21543,0,ruby looks at him with a smile
21544,0,ruby
21545,0,i didnt
21546,0,her smile widens and then she leaves the bed to join
21547,0,the doctor and beverly picard shakes his head and
21548,0,smiles after her chagrinned and amused at the same
21549,0,time
21550,0,ruby
21551,0,to doctor
21552,0,we cant take any more xrays
21553,0,until i can mix up a new batch of
21554,0,the silver halide
21555,0,doctor
21556,0,can you do it tonight we may
21557,0,have to operate
21558,0,ruby
21559,0,sure itll be ready by morning
21560,0,ruby turns and heads for the door picard moves after
21561,0,her
21562,0,picard
21563,0,ruby i need to talk to you
21564,0,about those photographs its
21565,0,very important
21566,0,ruby

21575,0,to think up a new set of lies
21576,0,she flashes him that smile again then darts out the
21577,0,door picard is left frustrated he knows that he
21578,0,cant let it go at that
21579,0,cut to
21580,0,int enterprise engineering
21581,0,worf and a team of ten security guards are preparing
21582,0,for battle theyre setting up large heavyduty
21583,0,phaser equivalents of machine guns big meanlooking
21584,0,weapons on tripods there are two of these weapons
21585,0,aimed at each entrance to engineering the security
21586,0,officers are strapping on body armor checking weapons
21587,0,building makeshift barricades over each of the doors
21588,0,worf is in command directing the action
21589,0,worf
21590,0,to team
21591,0,double check each assault
21592,0,phaser make certain that the
21593,0,range setting is no more than
21594,0,thirty meters we dont want to
21595,0,blast through the hull
21596,0,worf turns and picks up his batleth sword off a nearby
21597,0,console he checks the sharpness of the blade
21598,0,security officer
21599,0,are you sure you dont want
21600,0,something a little more
21601,0,sophisticated sir
21602,0,worf
21603,0,mind your post lieutenant
21604,0,the lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
21605,0,moves off worf makes a quick practiced motion with
21606,0,the sword decides hes ready
21607,0,int bridge
21608,0,riker and troi watching the schematic
21609,0,riker works a control and the display zooms in to
21610,0,display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
21611,0,engineering and the surrounding deck a swarm of dots
21612,0,representing the borg is advancing on engineering
21613,0,riker

21619,0,understood were ready
21620,0,riker and troi watch as the dots move closer
21621,0,closerright up to the perimeter of engineering
21622,0,the dots begin surrounding engineering which looks
21623,0,like its being swarmed over by a sea of ants
21624,0,int engineering
21625,0,as before the security guards have taken positions
21626,0,around the room all weapons trained on the doors
21627,0,worf is standing in front of the warp core batleth in
21628,0,hand
21629,0,worf
21630,0,calls out
21631,0,charge weapons
21632,0,a massive hum of power fills the room as all of the
21633,0,phaser weapons begin charging its tense everyone
21634,0,standing ready with their weapons charging this is
21635,0,the moment of truth
21636,0,worf stands ready phaser in one hand batleth in the
21637,0,other this is worf at his purest the warrior ready
21638,0,for battle
21639,0,int bridge
21640,0,riker and troi as before watching the schematic of
21641,0,the ship the dots representing borg have now
21642,0,completely surrounded engineering on all sides
21643,0,including the deck directly above and below in
21644,0,essence the borg have cocooned engineering from the
21645,0,rest of the ship
21646,0,int engineering
21647,0,as before worf and the security team in their
21648,0,positions tense a few beats of silencethen they
21649,0,start to hear soft scratching coming from somewhere
21650,0,behind the walls it sounds like rats skittering
21651,0,through the walls and ceiling of an old house
21652,0,everyone stays alert checks and rechecks their
21653,0,weapons a couple of hard swallows then from
21654,0,somewhere up above a loud metallic clang then a
21655,0,large scraping sound that seems to start at one end of
21656,0,the room and travel to the other theres an
21657,0,overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
21658,0,walls moving about its unnerving even for crack
21659,0,starfleet troops
21660,0,int bridge
21661,0,riker and troi watching the display the borg dots
21662,0,teeming around engineering like ants on a candy bar
21663,0,int engineering
21664,0,the clawing skittering clanging noises increase and
21665,0,get louder
21666,0,we expect to see the borg bursting into the room at
21667,0,any moment worf tightens his grip on his batleth
21668,0,teeth bared unbearable tension and then
21669,0,the noises begin to fade away eventually
21670,0,disappearing all together if anything the silence is
21671,0,even scarier worfs eyes narrow he looks around the
21672,0,room all his senses alert waiting for the slightest
21673,0,sign of the borg but nothing happens
21674,0,int bridge
21675,0,riker and troi react to the diagram as the borg dots
21676,0,begin moving away from engineering it looks like the
21677,0,swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
21678,0,ground moving toward the forward part of the ship
21679,0,troi
21680,0,theyre bypassing engineering
21681,0,riker
21682,0,where the hell are they going
21683,0,off the mystery
21684,0,cut to
21685,0,int borg hive
21686,0,close on datas face his eyes are closed he is in
21687,0,the android equivalent of sleep camera rotating and
21688,0,pushing in on his face as we hear the overlapping
21689,0,sounds of voices from datas past picard riker
21690,0,troi the enterprise crew aliens hes met datas own
21691,0,voice bits and pieces of his life
21692,0,the theme of the sound bites should be datas quest for
21693,0,humanity picard giving him advice troi counseling
21694,0,him soong talking to his son etc the last line of
21695,0,dialogue we hear is data saying i want to be more
21696,0,human
21697,0,borg queens voice
21698,0,data
21699,0,datas eyes fly open now awake we pull back
21700,0,revealing that data is still strapped to the borg
21701,0,operating table his right arm and shoulder are
21702,0,encased in some kind of strange cybernetic shell
21703,0,obscured from view clear tubes run out of the shell
21704,0,into borg machinery liquid is coursing through the
21705,0,tubes a couple of borg drones are moving about the
21706,0,room carrying out various tasks
21707,0,theres been a change since weve been here last
21708,0,there are now several plexiglass cylinders surrounding
21709,0,datas table each of them filled with some kind of
21710,0,murky red fluid which is swirling around every once
21711,0,in awhile something that looks like raw flesh bumps up
21712,0,against the clear plexiglass then disappears again
21713,0,we dont know what these tubes are for but theyre
21714,0,definitely creepy
21715,0,data takes all this in but there is nothing he can do
21716,0,hes still immobilized
21717,0,suddenly the table rotates and begins to move up toward
21718,0,the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling it
21719,0,stops a few feet away and data finds himself faceto
21720,0,face with the borg queen again
21721,0,borg queen
21722,0,youve taken your first step
21723,0,toward perfection how does it
21724,0,feel
21725,0,data
21726,0,i do not know what you are
21727,0,referring to
21728,0,borg queen
21729,0,thats because you havent been
21730,0,properly stimulated yet
21731,0,a whoosh of hydraulic power signals another movement by
21732,0,the borg queen she slithers through the air and down
21733,0,slightly so that she is on the same level as data
21734,0,she looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
21735,0,datas right arm which opens at her silent command and
21736,0,moves away
21737,0,we can now see that all of the skin has been removed
21738,0,from datas right arm showing the innerworkings of
21739,0,his android limb circuitry and servos etc but on
21740,0,the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
21741,0,new a small patch of human flesh held in place with
21742,0,various nastylooking hooks and clamps and small tubes
21743,0,carrying blood its a delicate fragile piece of
21744,0,organic life on an ugly mechanical surface
21745,0,data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
21746,0,puzzlement
21747,0,borg queen
21748,0,re flesh
21749,0,do you know what this is data
21750,0,data
21751,0,it would appear that you are
21752,0,attempting to graft organic skin
21753,0,onto my endoskeletal structure
21754,0,borg queen
21755,0,what a cold description for
21756,0,such a beautiful gift
21757,0,she smiles slightly utterly confident she leans her
21758,0,face in close to datas still immobilized right arm
21759,0,extreme close up datas arm
21760,0,we are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
21761,0,the individual hairs the borg queens lips move into
21762,0,frame and she exhales a long and sensuous breath we
21763,0,see goose bumps form on the skin and the hairs stand
21764,0,straight up in response
21765,0,
21766,0,new angle
21767,0,
21768,0,as datas eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
21769,0,surprise this is a sensation hes never felt before
21770,0,the borg queen sees the look on his face and smiles
21771,0,borg queen
21772,0,was that good for you
21773,0,data can barely describe the sensation but clearly
21774,0,it was pleasurable
21775,0,data
21776,0,it was interesting
21777,0,he looks at her
21778,0,data
21779,0,do it again please
21780,0,as she smiles
21781,0,cut to
21782,0,ext rubys house night
21783,0,a tiny singlestory house one or two rooms at the
21784,0,most in serious need of repair and maintenance no
21785,0,yard the house sits on dirt the nearest other
21786,0,structure is at least a hundred yards away a very
21787,0,solitary place the windows are dark painted over
21788,0,from the inside
21789,0,some large pieces of exoticlooking equipment are
21790,0,sitting off the front porch
21791,0,after a beat the front door opens letting out a soft
21792,0,feeble light
21793,0,ruby steps out onto the porch carrying a gallon size
21794,0,plastic jug the light from the house now lights the
21795,0,equipment a little giving us a better view theres
21796,0,a contraption that appears to be a pump of some kind
21797,0,with a funnel on top spigot at the bottom and several
21798,0,stages of filters and tubing in between ruby sets the
21799,0,jug underneath the spigot then sits down for a
21800,0,moment on the edge of the porch she takes a breath
21801,0,and runs a hand through her hair stretches her back
21802,0,trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck an
21803,0,exhausting day
21804,0,picard
21805,0,is watching her intently from afar hes concealed
21806,0,behind a supporting beam of one the towns many
21807,0,windmills hes in shadow hidden from rubys view
21808,0,ruby
21809,0,pulls off her jacket shes wearing a pullover
21810,0,shirt and in one motion she pulls off the shirt
21811,0,revealing only a teeshirt underneath sleeves torn off
21812,0,long ago she stands up kicks off her boots
21813,0,undoes her pants and begins sliding the jeans off
21814,0,her hips
21815,0,picard
21816,0,is surprised glances around a little awkward this
21817,0,really isnt why he came out here
21818,0,ruby
21819,0,kicks aside the jeans shes now down to teeshirt and
21820,0,panties she grabs the bottom of the teeshirt
21821,0,pulls it off
21822,0,picard
21823,0,doesnt want to look but cant help himself
21824,0,ruby
21825,0,moves to the side of the porch and steps into a
21826,0,large enviromental suit a bulky onepiece with gloves
21827,0,and helmet attached
21828,0,picard
21829,0,is a little relieved keeps watching
21830,0,ruby
21831,0,has now encased herself in the thick rubbery suit
21832,0,pulls over a helmet with a gas mask she walks over to
21833,0,an oil drum marked with a distinctive biohazard
21834,0,symbol she carefully opens the lid takes a metal
21835,0,pitcher reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
21836,0,pitcherfull of toxic waste she closes the lid walks
21837,0,over to the pumpfilter contraption she pours the
21838,0,sludgelike waste into the funnelprimes the pump
21839,0,makes a few adjustments to the filters and then
21840,0,turns the spigot
21841,0,after a beat a trickle of clear liquid starts to come
21842,0,out of the spigot ruby steps back and pulls off the
21843,0,helmet
21844,0,picard
21845,0,watches curious about what shes doing
21846,0,ruby
21847,0,is now out of the biosuit again pulling on her
21848,0,shirt and jeans grabs her jacket turns off the
21849,0,lights in the house and shuts the front door behind
21850,0,her she begins walking toward the windmill
21851,0,picard
21852,0,steps behind the girder stays very still in the
21853,0,shadows waits quietly as ruby passes by the windmill
21854,0,without a glance and heads into town after shes
21855,0,gone picard steps out from his hiding place watches
21856,0,her go then quickly heads for rubys house
21857,0,front porch
21858,0,picard opens the front door and goes inside but he
21859,0,doesnt notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
21860,0,red light starts flashing some sort of silent alarm
21861,0,int rubys house continuous
21862,0,picard enters and closes the door behind him its
21863,0,dark he fumbles around for a light switch finally
21864,0,locates one and a soft golden glow fills the room
21865,0,the house has only one room which functions as a
21866,0,living room kitchen bedroom etc this is also
21867,0,rubys darkroom the windows have been painted black
21868,0,and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo
21869,0,equipment all around but the most striking feature of
21870,0,the house are the large hanging clothprinted
21871,0,photographs they vary in size and shape some are
21872,0,hanging on walls others hang from the ceiling in mid
21873,0,air still others are stacked on the few pieces of
21874,0,furniture thats here the absence of paper has forced
21875,0,ruby to print photos on anything she can find
21876,0,bed sheets shirts pieces of upholstery backs of
21877,0,carpeting etc picard stands there for a moment
21878,0,taking in the scene hes never been in anyplace
21879,0,quite like this the cloth photos give the room a
21880,0,feeling of a small intensely personal gallery
21881,0,picard moves around the room looking from photo to
21882,0,photo hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
21883,0,silo and as he does we get our first close look at
21884,0,rubys images and they tell us a great deal about
21885,0,her
21886,0,she has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
21887,0,mundane and the ugly there are pictures of hope
21888,0,amidst despair beauty amongst devastation there
21889,0,seems to be a theme running through the photographs
21890,0,a romantic almost idealistic sense of optimism
21891,0,at one point picard finds a photograph he recognizes
21892,0,its the rustedout hover car she photographed on the
21893,0,streets of resurrection its an ugly decrepit piece
21894,0,of junk but there in the center spotlighted by a
21895,0,single ray of sunshine is a tiny flower about to
21896,0,bloom
21897,0,picard takes in the image for a brief moment then
21898,0,pushes onward goes to a file of photos sitting in a
21899,0,box begins sorting through them quickly we see
21900,0,prewar photos printed on real paper they show a
21901,0,younger ruby with her parents resurrection the way
21902,0,it used to look ruby with a dog
21903,0,picard pauses frowns gets the odd feeling that
21904,0,someone is watching him he turns around to see
21905,0,himself
21906,0,a three foot photograph of picard is drying in the air
21907,0,behind him
21908,0,ruby mustve taken the photo when picard was on the
21909,0,street talking to scrimm it was taken through a
21910,0,telephoto lens a closeup of picards face he looks
21911,0,focused determined heroic its a remarkable shot of
21912,0,the captain and even picard is a little taken aback by
21913,0,the image shes captured the essence of the man
21914,0,clickclack the sound of a shotgun being cocked
21915,0,picard freezes slowly turns around to see whos
21916,0,there
21917,0,rubby
21918,0,is standing in the open doorway a shotgun leveled at
21919,0,picard
21920,0,ruby
21921,0,you should pay closer attention to
21922,0,those little red lights
21923,0,picard glances down at the doorway sees the flashing
21924,0,red light in the doorjamb hes busted
21925,0,ruby
21926,0,you know id be perfectly
21927,0,justified in shooting you right
21928,0,now
21929,0,picard glances at the photograph of himself
21930,0,picard
21931,0,id say you already have
21932,0,ruby
21933,0,dont flatter yourself i take
21934,0,pictures of a lot of junk
21935,0,she perches herself on the arm of a small couch holds
21936,0,the gun loosely but never taking the aim away from
21937,0,picard
21938,0,ruby
21939,0,okay lets hear it im sure you
21940,0,have a great explanation for why
21941,0,those rocket photos are so
21942,0,important you broke into my house
21943,0,picard
21944,0,were trying to repair doctor
21945,0,cochranes ship its been
21946,0,damaged and
21947,0,ruby
21948,0,we
21949,0,picard
21950,0,myself and a few other friends
21951,0,of zephrams
21952,0,ruby
21953,0,friends from cornell
21954,0,picard
21955,0,some
21956,0,ruby
21957,0,lie thats one keep going
21958,0,picard
21959,0,a key piece of the ship has been
21960,0,destroyed and our only hope to
21961,0,reconstruct it is if one of your
21962,0,photographs shows us what it
21963,0,looked like
21964,0,ruby
21965,0,considers
21966,0,all right truth i believe that
21967,0,one why is it so urgent you
21968,0,couldnt wait until morning
21969,0,picard
21970,0,we have to launch his ship by
21971,0,tomorrow afternoon
21972,0,ruby
21973,0,or
21974,0,picard has to come up with something decides to
21975,0,throw her off with a hightech explanation
21976,0,picard
21977,0,or the shielding around the
21978,0,plutonium core will begin to
21979,0,deteriorate within a day the
21980,0,entire silo will become so
21981,0,radioactive that no one will be
21982,0,able to come near it for a hundred
21983,0,years
21984,0,ruby eyes him evenly
21985,0,ruby
21986,0,lie thats two one more and
21987,0,i pull the trigger
21988,0,picard is starting to get angry
21989,0,picard
21990,0,why are you being so difficult
21991,0,all im asking for is to look at
21992,0,one of the photographs itll
21993,0,take five minutes
21994,0,ruby
21995,0,and all im asking for is the
21996,0,truth that would take five
21997,0,minutes
21998,0,beat
21999,0,for all i know you caused the
22000,0,explosions at the silo and now
22001,0,youre trying to steal zephrams
22002,0,ship
22003,0,picard
22004,0,i am not a thief
22005,0,rubys had enough her temper flares and she gets off
22006,0,the couch takes a threatening step toward picard
22007,0,ruby
22008,0,no youre a petty burglar and a
22009,0,liar
22010,0,beat
22011,0,youre no friend of zephrams he
22012,0,is a great man hes not like you
22013,0,or me or any of the other zombies
22014,0,walking around this town
22015,0,picard jumps in with a quiet forceful quality
22016,0,picard
22017,0,no hes a man with vision he
22018,0,can see beyond the problems that
22019,0,surround us he knows theres a
22020,0,better future out there for
22021,0,everyone a future where crime
22022,0,poverty and war are things of the
22023,0,past a future where we reach
22024,0,out and seek our destiny in the
22025,0,stars
22026,0,beat
22027,0,i believe in that future too
22028,0,ruby i believe in it in every
22029,0,fiber of my being and im
22030,0,telling you if we dont launch
22031,0,that warp ship tomorrow theres
22032,0,a very good chance that future
22033,0,will never happen
22034,0,she eyes him for a moment and were not sure if his
22035,0,words have had any effect
22036,0,ruby still has her doubts but decides to go with her
22037,0,gutand finally hands him the photographs picard
22038,0,glances through them his expression tells us the
22039,0,photo he needs is in there
22040,0,picard
22041,0,you wont regret this
22042,0,they share a look and then picard turns and walks
22043,0,off into the night ruby watches him go and we can
22044,0,see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions
22045,0,something about that man has touched her
22046,0,night scpoe pov
22047,0,a telescopic green and white image of picard walking
22048,0,away from rubys home
22049,0,lieutenant scrimm
22050,0,is watching picard through a set of night vision
22051,0,binoculars perched on the roof of a nearby building
22052,0,he frowns wondering what picard is up to
22053,0,cut to
22054,0,ext space enterprise deflector dish
22055,0,the giant deflector array at the front of the ship
22056,0,a giant round bowlshaped array used for
22057,0,communications and shielding as we watch four
22058,0,hatches open surrounding the dish and borg start to
22059,0,emerge from the interior of the ship and crawl out on
22060,0,the hull the borg do not need pressure suits or
22061,0,breathing equipment they crawl around the hull with
22062,0,ease and onto the deflector dish
22063,0,pull back to reveal
22064,0,int enterprise bridge viewscreen
22065,0,where riker troi worf and nds are watching this
22066,0,image on the viewscreen
22067,0,riker
22068,0,what are they doing
22069,0,worf
22070,0,they appear to be modifying the
22071,0,deflector dish
22072,0,troi
22073,0,to do what if they wanted a
22074,0,weapon they couldve taken over
22075,0,a phaser bank or torpedo bay
22076,0,riker
22077,0,deflector dish why the
22078,0,deflector dish
22079,0,worf
22080,0,it doesnt make sense the
22081,0,deflector is only used for
22082,0,shielding and long range

22087,0,one alpha
22088,0,the image on the viewscreen zooms in to a specific
22089,0,point on the deflector dish giving us a clear view of
22090,0,two borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish
22091,0,they appear top be modifying power conduits in some
22092,0,fashion
22093,0,worf
22094,0,theyre rerouting the deflector

22098,0,the image now is overlaid with an infrared view of what
22099,0,theyre doing the power conduits are glowing bright
22100,0,red very hot we can see the heat signature travel
22101,0,back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrewshaped
22102,0,coil which is pulsing
22103,0,riker
22104,0,theyre connecting the conduits to
22105,0,subspace communications
22106,0,worf
22107,0,realizing
22108,0,theyre converting the deflector
22109,0,dish into an antennae
22110,0,troi
22111,0,they may be trying to send a
22112,0,message to the other borgthe
22113,0,borg in this time period
22114,0,
22115,0,worf
22116,0,what kind of message
22117,0,riker
22118,0,thinking
22119,0,if it was me id say attack
22120,0,earth now in the st
22121,0,century theyll be too strong
22122,0,in the th
22123,0,they think about this for a moment as they watch the
22124,0,borg swarming on the deflector array
22125,0,worf
22126,0,we have to stop them from sending
22127,0,that message
22128,0,riker
22129,0,agreed options
22130,0,worf
22131,0,destroy the deflector dish
22132,0,troi
22133,0,can we aim our dorsal phasers at
22134,0,it
22135,0,riker shakes his head
22136,0,riker
22137,0,weve lost control of all weapons
22138,0,systems transporters are
22139,0,down we cant get to a
22140,0,shuttlecraft and it would take
22141,0,us too long to fight our way down
22142,0,to deflector control
22143,0,they think
22144,0,worf
22145,0,there is another way commander
22146,0,do you remember your zerog combat
22147,0,training
22148,0,riker looks a little wary at the suggestion
22149,0,riker
22150,0,i remember it made me sick
22151,0,troi
22152,0,to worf
22153,0,what are you suggesting
22154,0,riker
22155,0,i think mister worf is suggesting
22156,0,that we go outside for a little
22157,0,stroll
22158,0,off their expressions

23172,0,wider
23173,0,data is still restrained on the table but a conduit
23174,0,has been placed above his head and is dripping
23175,0,condensation onto his face data is now a completely
23176,0,new being his entire body is now made of human flesh
23177,0,its a shocking sight for anyone who ever wondered
23178,0,what data would look like human were now getting our

23185,0,data although clearly enraptured with his new
23186,0,sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain

23188,0,data
23189,0,weak
23190,0,i am grateful for what you have
23191,0,given me but i still do not wish
23192,0,to be assimilated
23193,0,borg queen
23194,0,a universe of sensation is waiting
23195,0,for you dont you want to
23196,0,explore it with me
23197,0,to his surprise data finds that he is becoming drawn
23198,0,to this strange creature and all that she can offer
23199,0,him
23200,0,data
23201,0,yes
23202,0,borg queen
23203,0,then take the final step give
23204,0,me the enterprise and we can be
23205,0,together always
23206,0,he struggles but ultimately theres only one answer
23207,0,data
23208,0,no i cannot
23209,0,without taking her eyes away from data she reaches out
23210,0,a hand and touches a control on a nearby console the
23211,0,color of datas face turns an ashen gray as though
23212,0,the blood has drained from his skin another droplet
23213,0,of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek but this
23214,0,time his eyes widen in shock
23215,0,the sensation of human feeling is gone
23216,0,borg queen
23217,0,ive deactivated the sensory
23218,0,inputs that flesh on your body

23228,0,invasion we must assimilate
23229,0,earth ourselves i need this
23230,0,ship
23231,0,she hits the control and the color returns to his
23232,0,face data gasps filled with feeling once again
23233,0,the borg queen runs her hand across his cheek her
23234,0,attitude seductive and affectionate once again
23235,0,borg queen
23236,0,isnt it better like this

23252,0,let me into your mind
23253,0,data struggles anguished weve never seen him like
23254,0,this before completely beaten down finally he
23255,0,nods the borg queen touches the control again a
23256,0,sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to data
23257,0,and the queen kisses him on the mouth
23258,0,this time he responds eagerly throwing himself into
23259,0,the emotion of the moment she pulls back a little
23260,0,looks at him softly passionately data stares back at
23261,0,her breathless he seems to be completely in her
23262,0,thrall
23263,0,data
23264,0,in order to access my neural

23473,0,need weapons
23474,0,data
23475,0,thinks
23476,0,the problem must lie in the

23485,0,i believe so

23487,0,do it

25295,0,science officer he has taken a disruptor blast to the

25334,0,who attacked you doctor
25335,0,soran
25336,0,im not sure it happened so
25337,0,fast
25338,0,security officer
25339,0,calls out
25340,0,commander youd better take a

25356,0,data
25357,0,is she still angry
25358,0,geordi
25359,0,no but id stay out of sickbay
25360,0,for a while if i were you i
25361,0,still dont know why you dropped
25362,0,her in the water
25363,0,data
25364,0,i was attempting to get in the
25365,0,spirit of things i thought it
25366,0,would be humorous
25367,0,data frowns troubled by this recent experience he
25368,0,puts spot down and moves to a bulkhead he activates
25369,0,a control panel and a small compartment slides open
25370,0,revealing a small computer chip which is suspended in
25371,0,a glass and metal framework data looks at the chip
25372,0,for a beat and geordi moves to him in concern
25373,0,geordi
25374,0,data youre not thinking about
25375,0,using that thing are you
25376,0,data
25377,0,it has occurred to me on several
25378,0,occasions but i believe this may
25379,0,be the appropriate time
25380,0,geordi
25381,0,wait a minute i thought youve
25382,0,always been afraid it would
25383,0,overload your neural net
25384,0,data
25385,0,that is true however i believe
25386,0,my growth as an artificial
25387,0,life form has reached an impasse
25388,0,for thirtyfour years i have
25389,0,endeavored to become more human
25390,0,to grow beyond my original
25391,0,programming and yet i am still
25392,0,unable to grasp such a simple
25393,0,concept as humor
25394,0,re chip
25395,0,this emotion chip is the only
25396,0,answer
25397,0,geordi considers a moment looks at the chip
25398,0,and reluctantly has to agree
25399,0,geordi
25400,0,all right
25401,0,data sits down and la forge moves to stand behind him
25402,0,geordi
25403,0,but at the first sign of trouble
25404,0,im going to deactivate it
25405,0,agreed
25406,0,data
25407,0,agreed
25408,0,geordi works on datas head for a moment and then
25409,0,opens a panel on datas head revealing the blinking
25410,0,circuitry within
25411,0,cut to
25412,0,int ready room
25413,0,riker is standing next to picard who has his back turned
25414,0,and is staring out the window picard seems distracted
25415,0,during the scene his mind clearly elsewhere as riker
25416,0,finishes his report
25417,0,riker
25418,0,we found two dead romulans aboard
25419,0,the station were analyzing
25420,0,their equipment to see if we can
25421,0,determine what ship they came
25422,0,from
25423,0,picard nods absently
25424,0,picard
25425,0,theres still no indication of why
25426,0,they attacked the station
25427,0,riker
25428,0,we think they were looking for
25429,0,something they practically tore
25430,0,the place apart
25431,0,picard
25432,0,hmm
25433,0,beat
25434,0,inform starfleet command this
25435,0,could indicate a new romulan
25436,0,threat in this sector
25437,0,riker
25438,0,you want me to contact starfleet
25439,0,picard
25440,0,is there a problem
25441,0,riker
25442,0,no sir
25443,0,picard
25444,0,thank you number one
25445,0,picard keeps his back turned looking out the window
25446,0,riker hesitates awkward
25447,0,riker
25448,0,there is something else captain
25449,0,one of the scientists a doctor
25450,0,soran has insisted on speaking
25451,0,with you
25452,0,beat
25453,0,i told him you were busy sir but
25454,0,he said it was absolutely
25455,0,imperative that he speak with you
25456,0,right away
25457,0,picard
25458,0,understood that will be all
25459,0,riker
25460,0,sir is there anything wrong
25461,0,picard
25462,0,no thank you
25463,0,a beat then riker turns and exits off picards
25464,0,unreadable face
25465,0,cut to
25466,0,
25467,0,int ten forward
25468,0,the room is bustling with patrons and activity data
25469,0,enters with an odd look on his facehis body
25470,0,language subtly altered he is looking at the world
25471,0,through new eyes geordi is following him closely
25472,0,watching his every move they move to the bar guinan
25473,0,comes over she has not aged at all since the
25474,0,enterpriseb she sets down an exoticlooking container
25475,0,full of dark liquid
25476,0,guinan
25477,0,you two just volunteered to be my
25478,0,first victims
25479,0,re liquid
25480,0,this is a new concoction i
25481,0,picked up on forcas three trust me
25482,0,youre going to love it
25483,0,she pours two glasses of the liquid data takes one
25484,0,and sniffs it then takes a drink geordi watches him
25485,0,closely data frowns
25486,0,geordi
25487,0,well
25488,0,data
25489,0,i believe the beverage has
25490,0,provoked an emotional response
25491,0,geordi
25492,0,really what do you feel
25493,0,data
25494,0,i am uncertain i have had little
25495,0,experience with emotions i am
25496,0,unable to articulate the
25497,0,sensation
25498,0,guinan
25499,0,emotions
25500,0,geordi
25501,0,ill explain later
25502,0,data finishes the drink concentrates tries to make
25503,0,sense of the rush of feelings his expression is one
25504,0,of disgust
25505,0,guinan
25506,0,to geordi
25507,0,i dont think he likes it
25508,0,data
25509,0,excited
25510,0,yes that is it i hate it
25511,0,geordi
25512,0,data i think the chip is
25513,0,working
25514,0,data looks at geordi with a big smile on his face
25515,0,data
25516,0,yes i hate this it is
25517,0,revolting
25518,0,beat
25519,0,guinan
25520,0,another round
25521,0,data
25522,0,please
25523,0,in the bg we see picard enter ten forward
25524,0,follow picard
25525,0,as he walks through ten forward and heads toward a
25526,0,table by the windows soran is sitting at the table
25527,0,staring out at the stars lost in thought his
25528,0,observatory uniform is distinctive and sets him apart
25529,0,from everyone else in the room picard walks up to the
25530,0,table
25531,0,picard
25532,0,doctor soran
25533,0,soran
25534,0,yes yes captain thank you for
25535,0,coming
25536,0,the men shake hands and picard sits down soran is an
25537,0,imposing physical presence but at the moment he seems
25538,0,very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his
25539,0,work picard waves away a waiter
25540,0,picard
25541,0,nothing for me
25542,0,brusque to soran
25543,0,i understand theres something
25544,0,urgent you need to discuss with
25545,0,me
25546,0,soran
25547,0,yes i need to return to the
25548,0,observatory immediately i must
25549,0,continue a critical experiment i
25550,0,was running on the amargosa star
25551,0,
25552,0,picards reaction is a little impatient this doesnt
25553,0,sound that imperative to him
25554,0,picard
25555,0,doctor were still conducting
25556,0,an investigation into the attack
25557,0,once weve completed our work
25558,0,well be happy to allow you and
25559,0,your fellow scientists back aboard
25560,0,the observatory until then
25561,0,soran
25562,0,the timing is very important on my
25563,0,experiment if it is not
25564,0,completed within the next twelve
25565,0,hours years of research will be
25566,0,lost
25567,0,picard
25568,0,were doing the best we can now
25569,0,if youll excuse me
25570,0,picard moves to stand but soran reaches out and gently
25571,0,but firmly grabs him by the arm the unexpected
25572,0,physical contact and the change of intensity in sorans
25573,0,face stops picard in his tracks
25574,0,soran
25575,0,cryptically
25576,0,they say time is the fire in
25577,0,which we burn and right now
25578,0,captain my time is running out
25579,0,beat
25580,0,we leave so many things unfinished
25581,0,in our lives im sure you can
25582,0,understand
25583,0,for some reason sorans words have struck a deep chord
25584,0,within picard
25585,0,he looks away from sorans compelling gaze and thinks
25586,0,for a long moment when he finally speaks his voice
25587,0,is barely above a whisper
25588,0,
25589,0,picard
25590,0,ill see what i can do
25591,0,picard walks away without a word before soran can
25592,0,thank him soran looks after him with relief then
25593,0,pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens it he
25594,0,looks at the watch for a long moment then snaps it
25595,0,closed and head for the opposite exit from the one
25596,0,picard took follow soran across ten forwarduntil
25597,0,he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees
25598,0,sorans pov
25599,0,of guinan who is now back at the bar
25600,0,resume soran
25601,0,a dark look crosses his face he is disturbed by the
25602,0,sight of guinan he quickly turns and exits
25603,0,on guinan
25604,0,she begins to sense something as though someone is
25605,0,watching her she turns looks in the direction where
25606,0,soran was just standing but theres no one there now
25607,0,she shakes off the feeling and goes back to work
25608,0,cut to
25609,0,int engineering
25610,0,a short time later a romulan tricorder is connected
25611,0,to some diagnostic equipment near a console worf is
25612,0,talking to riker
25613,0,worf activates a monitor which shows a complex diagram
25614,0,of sensor information
25615,0,worf
25616,0,one of the dead romulans had a
25617,0,tricorder we analyzed its sensor
25618,0,logs and found they were scanning
25619,0,for signature particles of a
25620,0,compound called trilithium
25621,0,riker
25622,0,trilithium
25623,0,worf
25624,0,an experimental compound the
25625,0,romulans have been working on in
25626,0,theory a trilithiumbased
25627,0,explosive would be thousands of
25628,0,times more powerful than an
25629,0,antimatter weapon but they never
25630,0,found a way to stabilize it
25631,0,
25632,0,riker
25633,0,why were they looking for it on a
25634,0,federation observatory it doesnt
25635,0,make any sense
25636,0,riker considers
25637,0,riker
25638,0,contd
25639,0,have geordi and data go over with
25640,0,the next away team tell them to
25641,0,scan the observatory for
25642,0,trilithium
25643,0,worf
25644,0,aye sir
25645,0,cut to

25650,0,off tricorder
25651,0,theres no sign of any trilithium
25652,0,in here
25653,0,geordi continues to scan then suddenly data lets out
25654,0,a quiet giggle geordi stops and turns to look at him
25655,0,data giggles louder
25656,0,data
25657,0,laughing to himself
25658,0,i get it i get it
25659,0,geordi

25662,0,data
25663,0,when you said to commander
25664,0,riker
25665,0,imitating geordis voice
25666,0,the clown can stay but the
25667,0,ferengi in the gorilla suit has to
25668,0,go
25669,0,geordi looks blankly at him for a moment
25670,0,geordi
25671,0,what
25672,0,data
25673,0,during the farpoint mission we
25674,0,were on the bridge and you told a
25675,0,joke that was the punch line
25676,0,geordi
25677,0,the farpoint mission data that
25678,0,was seven years ago
25679,0,data
25680,0,i know i just got it
25681,0,laughs
25682,0,it was very funny
25683,0,geordi
25684,0,thanks
25685,0,geordi indicates a corridor they exit in that
25686,0,direction
25687,0,int observatory corridor continuous
25688,0,a short corridor connecting the ops center with other
25689,0,compartments geordi suddenly stops in front of what
25690,0,appears to be a standard bulkhead
25691,0,geordi
25692,0,wait a minute theres a hidden
25693,0,doorway here i can see the
25694,0,joint of the metal with my visor
25695,0,geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what
25696,0,appears to be a smooth bulkhead
25697,0,data
25698,0,off tricorder
25699,0,there appears to be a dampening
25700,0,field in operation i cannot scan
25701,0,beyond the bulkhead
25702,0,geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for
25703,0,a way to open the door
25704,0,geordi
25705,0,i dont see a control panelor
25706,0,an access port
25707,0,data
25708,0,off tricorder
25709,0,it appears to be a magnetically
25710,0,sealed
25711,0,data steps forward and opens a small panel on wrist
25712,0,and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within
25713,0,data
25714,0,i believe i can reverse the
25715,0,polarity by attenuating my axial
25716,0,servo
25717,0,data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist
25718,0,over the door panel
25719,0,data
25720,0,joking
25721,0,open sesame
25722,0,there is a humming sound followed by a loud click the

25725,0,smiles
25726,0,you could say i have a magnetic
25727,0,personality
25728,0,geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace they exit
25729,0,to
25730,0,int observatory probe room continuous
25731,0,a small room with several probes stacked in holding
25732,0,racks geordi and data scan
25733,0,geordi
25734,0,im still not picking up anything
25735,0,someone went to a lot of trouble
25736,0,to shield this room
25737,0,they put their tricorders away and begin looking around
25738,0,the room data continues to snicker and giggle as he
25739,0,tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up
25740,0,geordi begins inspecting the probes finally stops
25741,0,at one probe which has several odd devices attached to
25742,0,the side
25743,0,geordi
25744,0,data take a look at this
25745,0,data comes over
25746,0,you ever seen a solar probe with
25747,0,this kind of configuration
25748,0,data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he
25749,0,opens and closes it like a mouth
25750,0,data
25751,0,making tricorder talk
25752,0,no geordi i have not it is
25753,0,most unusual
25754,0,
25755,0,data giggles and geordi reacts with the irritation of
25756,0,someone listening to a very bad comedian
25757,0,
25758,0,geordi
25759,0,just help me get this panel open
25760,0,data helps geordi as they try to open a panel on the
25761,0,casing of the probe they open the panel and geordi
25762,0,looks insidehe reacts to something
25763,0,geordi
25764,0,whoa my visors picking up
25765,0,something in the theta bandit
25766,0,could be a trilithium signature
25767,0,data suddenly start laughing geordi turns in
25768,0,irritation
25769,0,geordi
25770,0,data this isnt the time
25771,0,data
25772,0,laughing
25773,0,i am sorry but i cannot stop
25774,0,myself i think something is
25775,0,wrong
25776,0,a angle vfxp a
25777,0,datas laughter escalates into hysteria then data
25778,0,begins to jerk and shake and goes into a bizarre
25779,0,emotional seizure a rush of emotions race across
25780,0,his face anger passion shock a kaleidoscopic
25781,0,blur of reactions contort his features then it stops
25782,0,and he falls to the ground
25783,0,geordi
25784,0,data
25785,0,geordi rushes to him data has a look of surprise on
25786,0,his face as he blinks a few times he sits up
25787,0,geordi
25788,0,data are you all right
25789,0,data
25790,0,i believe the emotional chip has
25791,0,overloaded my positronic relays

25809,0,will you give me a hand
25810,0,over the above dialogue soran glances over at the

25812,0,panel and a disturbed look crosses his face
25813,0,soran looks back at geordi
25814,0,soran
25815,0,id be happy to
25816,0,soran moves toward them and then without warning he
25817,0,punches geordi in the face knocking the visor across
25818,0,the room he whirls around and points a phaser at
25819,0,data who suddenly looks fearful

25844,0,troi
25845,0,im afraid i cant just leave it
25846,0,at that the commanding officer
25847,0,of this ship is clearly distraught
25848,0,about something as ships
25849,0,counselor its my duty to
25850,0,picard
25851,0,as ships counselor its your
25852,0,duty to know not only when youre

25868,0,beat
25869,0,admiral lusby regarding the
25870,0,unusual behavior of jeanluc
25871,0,picard i find him increasingly
25872,0,irritable remote and
25873,0,uncooperative i recommend forced
25874,0,shore leave at a starbase facility
25875,0,in order to
25876,0,picard
25877,0,all right all right youve made
25878,0,your point
25879,0,troi takes a seat and patiently waits picard gets
25880,0,upmoves around the room for a momentand stops
25881,0,he speaks in a flat unemotional tone of voice
25882,0,picard
25883,0,the message i received

25885,0,my brother and his son my
25886,0,nephew burned to death in a

25890,0,troi
25891,0,captain im sorry

25893,0,i know there were a lot of
25894,0,unresolved conflicts between you
25895,0,and your brother
25896,0,picard
25897,0,what i cant get out of my mind is
25898,0,the image of rene my nephew
25899,0,i just cant believe hes gone
25900,0,he trails off
25901,0,troi
25902,0,its only natural to feel a
25903,0,heightened sense of tragedy when
25904,0,a child dies
25905,0,sensing more
25906,0,but it goes deeper than that
25907,0,doesnt it i can sense that rene
25908,0,meant a great deal to you
25909,0,picard
25910,0,in a way he was as close as i
25911,0,ever came to having a child of my
25912,0,own
25913,0,troi eyes an open photo album on the table she reaches
25914,0,over and flips through the pages for a moment there
25915,0,are many photos inside from many periods in time
25916,0,including one of picards brother standing next to his
25917,0,young son this is the picard family album
25918,0,troi
25919,0,your family history is very
25920,0,important to you isnt it
25921,0,picard
25922,0,nods
25923,0,ever since i was a little boy i
25924,0,remember hearing about the family
25925,0,line the picards that fought at
25926,0,trafalgar the picards that
25927,0,settled the first martian colony
25928,0,when my brother married and had a
25929,0,son
25930,0,picard hesitates this is difficult for him
25931,0,troi
25932,0,you felt it was no longer your
25933,0,responsibility to carry on the
25934,0,family line
25935,0,picard
25936,0,nods
25937,0,my brother had shouldered that
25938,0,burden allowing me to pursue my
25939,0,own selfish needs
25940,0,troi
25941,0,theres nothing selfish about
25942,0,pursuing your own life your own
25943,0,career
25944,0,picard moves to the window stares outside a shadow
25945,0,crosses his face hes getting to the heart of the
25946,0,matter
25947,0,picard
25948,0,you know counselor im not
25949,0,getting any younger for some
25950,0,time now ive been aware that
25951,0,there are fewer days ahead than
25952,0,there are behind
25953,0,beat
25954,0,but i always took comfort in the
25955,0,fact that when i was gone my
25956,0,family would continue but now
25957,0,picard moves back to the photo album open it to the
25958,0,last page an then flips through the remaining pages
25959,0,they are blank
25960,0,picard
25961,0,ive had brushes with death
25962,0,more than i care to contemplate
25963,0,i always accepted it as a
25964,0,calculated risk that goes along
25965,0,with wearing this uniform
25966,0,beat
25967,0,but now the idea of death has

26150,0,soran
26151,0,they knew it was aboard the
26152,0,observatory if the enterprise
26153,0,hadnt intervened they would have
26154,0,found it
26155,0,lursa
26156,0,but they didnt find it and now
26157,0,we have a weapon of unlimited
26158,0,power
26159,0,soran
26160,0,i have the weapon lursa and if
26161,0,you ever want me to give it to
26162,0,you i advise you to be a little
26163,0,more careful in the future
26164,0,betor grabs soran and holds a wickedlooking knife to
26165,0,his throat
26166,0,betor
26167,0,perhaps we are tired of waiting
26168,0,soran is unfazed by this threat
26169,0,soran
26170,0,without my research the
26171,0,trilithium is worthless as are
26172,0,your plans to reconquer the
26173,0,klingon empire

26184,0,klingon guard
26185,0,what shall i do with this
26186,0,soran moves toward geordi a grim look on his face
26187,0,
26188,0,soran
26189,0,bring him with me i need some
26190,0,answers from mr la forge
26191,0,soran exits
26192,0,cut to

26194,0,int corridor
26195,0,riker and worf are on the move down the corridor
26196,0,worf
26197,0,i have spoken to the klingon high

26201,0,riker
26202,0,surprised
26203,0,lursa and betor this doesnt
26204,0,make any sense a renowned
26205,0,stellar physicist somehow uses a
26206,0,trilithium probe to destroy a
26207,0,star kidnaps geordi and
26208,0,escapes with a pair of klingon
26209,0,renegades why what the hells
26210,0,going on
26211,0,they exit to

26213,0,worf and riker enter beverly is closing a panel on
26214,0,the back of datas head he is sitting on a biobed
26215,0,scanning himself with a tricorder
26216,0,riker
26217,0,how is he
26218,0,beverly
26219,0,it looks like a power surge fused
26220,0,the emotional chip into his neural
26221,0,net
26222,0,worf
26223,0,will that be a danger to him
26224,0,beverly
26225,0,i dont think so the chip still
26226,0,seems to be working id feel
26227,0,better if i could take a closer
26228,0,look but i cant remove it
26229,0,without completely dismantling his
26230,0,cerebral conduit
26231,0,riker
26232,0,to data
26233,0,looks like youre stuck with
26234,0,emotions for a while how do you
26235,0,feel
26236,0,data
26237,0,i am quite preoccupied with
26238,0,concern about geordi
26239,0,riker
26240,0,we all are data but were going
26241,0,to get him back
26242,0,data
26243,0,i hope so sir
26244,0,datas expression is still one of concern beverly
26245,0,pulls riker aside
26246,0,beverly
26247,0,wil i checked into doctor sorans
26248,0,background
26249,0,beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of
26250,0,doctor soran along with some biographical information
26251,0,appears
26252,0,beverly
26253,0,hes an elaurian over three
26254,0,hundred years old he lost his
26255,0,entire family when the borg
26256,0,destroyed his world soran
26257,0,escaped with a handful of other
26258,0,refugees aboard a ship called the
26259,0,lakul the ship was destroyed by
26260,0,some kind of energy ribbon but
26261,0,soran and fortysix others were
26262,0,rescued by the enterpriseb
26263,0,riker
26264,0,reacts
26265,0,that was the mission where james
26266,0,kirk was killed
26267,0,beverly
26268,0,i checked the passenger manifest
26269,0,of the lakul guess who else was
26270,0,on board
26271,0,she hits a control and suddenly guinans face appears
26272,0,on the screen riker reacts to the image
26273,0,cut to
26274,0,int guinans quarters
26275,0,close on guinan as she looks up surprised
26276,0,guinan
26277,0,soran thats a name i havent
26278,0,heard in a long time
26279,0,move to reveal guinans quarters which are unlike any
26280,0,of the others on the enterprise none of the standard
26281,0,furniture consoles or decoration are present the
26282,0,floor is made of tile not carpet the walls are
26283,0,draped in exotic fabric the lighting is moody and
26284,0,subdued
26285,0,picard is standing before guinan who is sitting cross
26286,0,legged on the floor they talk to each other with an
26287,0,easy familiarity two old friends who know each
26288,0,other well
26289,0,picard
26290,0,do you remember him
26291,0,guinan
26292,0,oh yes i remember everyone who
26293,0,was on the lakul every face
26294,0,even the ones who didnt make
26295,0,it
26296,0,guinan stands and begins to move about the room
26297,0,shes clearly troubled by the memories she hesitates
26298,0,looks off into the middledistance for a few moments
26299,0,picard moves to her
26300,0,picard
26301,0,guinan its important that you
26302,0,tell me what you know we think
26303,0,sorans developed a weapon a
26304,0,terrible weapon it might give
26305,0,him enough power to
26306,0,guinan
26307,0,soran doesnt care about power or
26308,0,weapons all he cares about is
26309,0,getting back to the nexus
26310,0,picard
26311,0,whats the nexus
26312,0,guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some
26313,0,exoticlooking alien artifacts distracting
26314,0,herself this is difficult for her to discuss
26315,0,guinan
26316,0,its a place ive tried very hard
26317,0,to forget
26318,0,she makes the decision to plunge ahead
26319,0,guinan
26320,0,that ribbon isnt just some random
26321,0,energy phenomenon traveling
26322,0,through space its a doorway
26323,0,it leads to another place the
26324,0,nexus it doesnt exist in our
26325,0,universe and it doesnt play by
26326,0,the same rules either
26327,0,picard
26328,0,what happened to you
26329,0,guinan
26330,0,i cant remember very much what
26331,0,it looked like or how long i was
26332,0,there but i do remember how it
26333,0,felt
26334,0,she turns to him and her face is filled with some kind
26335,0,of awe at the memory
26336,0,guinan
26337,0,it was like being inside joy
26338,0,as if joy was a real thing that i
26339,0,could wrap around myself ive
26340,0,never been so content
26341,0,a long beat as picard absorbs her words
26342,0,picard
26343,0,but then you were beamed away
26344,0,guinan shows a rare burst of anger
26345,0,guinan
26346,0,i was pulled away i didnt want
26347,0,to leave none of us did i felt
26348,0,like id left a part of myself
26349,0,behind all i could think about
26350,0,was getting back i didnt care
26351,0,what i had to do
26352,0,guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars
26353,0,guinan
26354,0,it took a long time but
26355,0,eventually i learned to live with
26356,0,it and i began to realize that
26357,0,my experience in the nexus had
26358,0,changed me
26359,0,beat
26360,0,i knew things about people
26361,0,about eventsabout time
26362,0,picard
26363,0,your sixth sense ive always
26364,0,wondered where it came from
26365,0,beat
26366,0,and what about soran
26367,0,guinan
26368,0,soran may still be obsessed with
26369,0,getting back and if he is hell
26370,0,do anything to find that doorway
26371,0,again
26372,0,picard
26373,0,but why destroy a star
26374,0,beat
26375,0,thank you guinan
26376,0,he heads for the door
26377,0,guinan
26378,0,let someone else do it jeanluc
26379,0,picard stops looks at her
26380,0,guinan
26381,0,let them send another starship
26382,0,dont get near the ribbon if you
26383,0,go into that nexus youre not
26384,0,going to care about soran or the
26385,0,enterprise or me all youre
26386,0,going to care about is how it
26387,0,feels to be there
26388,0,beat
26389,0,and youre never going to come
26390,0,back
26391,0,picard weighs her words sees the warning in her
26392,0,eyes and carefully backs away and exits
26393,0,cut to
26394,0,int klingon bird of prey quarters vfxp
26395,0,a dimlylit room somewhere in the bowels of the klingon
26396,0,ship like every other room on this decrepit ship the
26397,0,room looks wellworn and illmaintained soran is
26398,0,seated behind a table holding the visor a padd and
26399,0,sorans pocket watch sit on the table geordi is
26400,0,sitting in a chair across from him his shirt has
26401,0,been removed he looks very tense
26402,0,
26403,0,soran
26404,0,re visor
26405,0,a remarkable piece of equipment
26406,0,but a little inelegant wouldnt
26407,0,you say
26408,0,beat
26409,0,have you ever considered a
26410,0,prosthesis that would make you
26411,0,look a little more normal
26412,0,geordi
26413,0,whats normal
26414,0,soran
26415,0,normal is what everyone else is
26416,0,and what you are not
26417,0,geordi
26418,0,what do you want
26419,0,soran takes a moment
26420,0,soran
26421,0,as you may or may not be aware i
26422,0,am an elaurian some people call
26423,0,us a race of listeners we
26424,0,listen
26425,0,beat
26426,0,right now mr la forge you
26427,0,have my undivided attention i
26428,0,want to listen to everything you
26429,0,know about trilithium and me
26430,0,geordi thinks
26431,0,geordi
26432,0,trilithium is an experimental
26433,0,compound developed by the
26434,0,romulans i think its a
26435,0,derivative of
26436,0,soran picks up the padd from the desk and activates it
26437,0,suddenly something small with sharp edges can be
26438,0,seen moving just underneath geordis skin near his
26439,0,chest geordi moves his hand to the spot but then the
26440,0,protrusion is suddenly gone
26441,0,soran
26442,0,i dont want a science lecture
26443,0,you were on that observatory
26444,0,looking for trilithium why
26445,0,geordi
26446,0,i was ordered to by the captain
26447,0,on the padd in sorans hand we can now see an interior
26448,0,graphic of geordis body sitting in the chair the
26449,0,graphic is interactive moving as geordi moves
26450,0,a blinking dot represents the movement of the probe
26451,0,inside his body right now the dot is in the middle
26452,0,of his chest
26453,0,soran
26454,0,lets try to move beyond the usual
26455,0,prisonerinterrogator banter
26456,0,shall we you have information
26457,0,and i need it
26458,0,beat
26459,0,did the captain explain his orders
26460,0,to you did he say why you were
26461,0,searching for trilithium
26462,0,geordi
26463,0,no
26464,0,soran
26465,0,what about guinan what has
26466,0,she told you about me
26467,0,geordi
26468,0,guinan i dont know what youre
26469,0,talking about
26470,0,on the padd we now see the dot has moved to a position
26471,0,next to geordis heart soran looks up at geordi
26472,0,soran
26473,0,my instincts tell me youre lying
26474,0,and i know that cant be easy for
26475,0,you
26476,0,off padd
26477,0,i can see you have a good heart
26478,0,soran taps a control on the padd suddenly geordi
26479,0,grabs his chest in pain soran watches geordi for a
26480,0,few seconds then taps the padd again geordi gasps
26481,0,and starts to breathe
26482,0,soran
26483,0,oh i forgot to tell you while
26484,0,you were unconscious i injected
26485,0,a nanoprobe into your
26486,0,bloodstream its been navigating
26487,0,your cardiovascular system and
26488,0,right now ive attached it to your
26489,0,left ventricle
26490,0,smiles
26491,0,a little trick i picked up
26492,0,from the borg
26493,0,geordi
26494,0,gasping
26495,0,yeah theyre full of great
26496,0,ideas
26497,0,soran
26498,0,i just stopped your heart for five
26499,0,seconds it felt like an
26500,0,eternity didnt it did you know
26501,0,that you can stop the human heart
26502,0,for up to ten minutes before the
26503,0,onset of brain damage
26504,0,geordi
26505,0,no i didnt know that
26506,0,soran
26507,0,we learn something new about
26508,0,ourselves every day
26509,0,beat
26510,0,now maybe i didnt make myself
26511,0,clear it is very important that
26512,0,you tell me exactly what captain
26513,0,picard knows
26514,0,geordi
26515,0,i told you everything you might
26516,0,as well just kill me right now
26517,0,sorans features soften as he smiles slightly for a
26518,0,moment he looks genuinely compassionate and its
26519,0,a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity
26520,0,soran
26521,0,im not a killer mr la forge
26522,0,beat
26523,0,lets try thirty seconds
26524,0,soran taps a control on the padd geordi gasps and
26525,0,strains against an unimaginable pain
26526,0,soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover
26527,0,sits back in his chair watching the seconds tick
26528,0,away
26529,0,cut to
26530,0,int stellar cartography vfxp
26531,0,a room filled with exoticlooking devices sensors and
26532,0,computers which handle the enormous task of tracking
26533,0,the ships position in space
26534,0,the monitors around the room display various diagrams
26535,0,of the energy ribbon as seen in the beginning of the
26536,0,film
26537,0,data is sitting at a computer console which has a great
26538,0,deal of complex information on the screen picard is
26539,0,standing next to him throughout the following data
26540,0,seems distracted and preoccupied
26541,0,
26542,0,data
26543,0,according to our information the
26544,0,ribbon is a conflux of temporal
26545,0,energy which travels through our
26546,0,galaxy every thirtynine point one
26547,0,years
26548,0,picard
26549,0,when is it expected back
26550,0,data doesnt answer right away
26551,0,picard
26552,0,data
26553,0,data
26554,0,sorry captain the ribbon has
26555,0,already entered the galaxy it
26556,0,will pass through this sector in
26557,0,approximately thirtyone hours
26558,0,picard moves about the room hes frustrated
26559,0,tired but determined to find out whats going on
26560,0,picard
26561,0,guinan said soran was trying to
26562,0,get back to the ribbon if
26563,0,thats true then there must be
26564,0,some connection with the amargosa
26565,0,star
26566,0,data
26567,0,the stars destruction has had
26568,0,numerous astrophysical effects
26569,0,within this sector however none
26570,0,of them appear to have a
26571,0,connection to the energy ribbon
26572,0,picard
26573,0,give me a list of those effects
26574,0,i want to know every single thing
26575,0,which has been altered or
26576,0,changed no matter how
26577,0,insignificant
26578,0,data
26579,0,it will take a few moments for the
26580,0,computer to compile the
26581,0,information
26582,0,data works the computer and then the computer begins to
26583,0,work data sighs his expression becomes downcast
26584,0,and gloomy he sits down and puts his head in his
26585,0,hands picard finally has to say something
26586,0,picard
26587,0,data are you all right
26588,0,data
26589,0,no sir i am finding it
26590,0,difficult to concentrate i
26591,0,believe i am overwhelmed with
26592,0,feelings of remorse and regret
26593,0,concerning my actions on the
26594,0,observatory
26595,0,picard
26596,0,what do you mean
26597,0,data
26598,0,i wanted to save geordi i
26599,0,tried but i experienced
26600,0,something i did not expect
26601,0,beat
26602,0,i believe it was fear
26603,0,picard regards him sympathetically
26604,0,picard
26605,0,fear is a very difficult emotion
26606,0,to overcome its something we
26607,0,all have to learn to deal with
26608,0,data
26609,0,but i did not deal with it sir
26610,0,i let it prevent me from helping
26611,0,my friend
26612,0,beat
26613,0,does that make me a coward
26614,0,picard
26615,0,no and what you must try to
26616,0,avoid is becoming consumed by
26617,0,another emotion which i believe
26618,0,youre beginning to experience
26619,0,guilt
26620,0,data
26621,0,considers
26622,0,guilt it is a most unpleasant
26623,0,feeling
26624,0,a angle vfxp a
26625,0,the computer finishes its calculations and the console
26626,0,beeps data works the console information appears on
26627,0,screen
26628,0,data
26629,0,according to our current
26630,0,information the destruction of
26631,0,the amargosa star has had the
26632,0,following effects in this sector
26633,0,gamma emissions have increased by
26634,0,five percent the starship
26635,0,bozeman was forced to make a
26636,0,course correction a research
26637,0,project on gorik four was
26638,0,halted due to increased neutrino
26639,0,particles ambient magnetic
26640,0,fields have decreased by
26641,0,picard
26642,0,wait the bozeman why did it
26643,0,change course
26644,0,data
26645,0,matter of fact
26646,0,the destruction of the amargosa
26647,0,star has altered the gravitational
26648,0,forces throughout the sector any
26649,0,ship passing through this region
26650,0,will have to make a minor course
26651,0,correction

28129,0,antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles
28130,0,and starfleet paraphernalia picard hesitates in the
28131,0,doorway a little unsure about rushing into some
28132,0,strangers house
28133,0,kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove
28134,0,its very hot he quickly sets it down near the sink
28135,0,waves the smoke away with his hand
28136,0,kirk
28137,0,looks like someone was cooking
28138,0,eggs
28139,0,to picard

28145,0,picard
28146,0,im captain jeanluc picard of the
28147,0,starship enterprise
28148,0,before kirk can react to this remark an antique clock
28149,0,on a shelf chimes as it strikes the hour kirk moves
28150,0,to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and
28151,0,wonder he is entranced by this experience beginning
28152,0,to connect with things and memories from his past
28153,0,kirk
28154,0,this clock i gave this clock to
28155,0,bones
28156,0,picard
28157,0,pressing on
28158,0,im from what you would consider
28159,0,the future the twentyfourth
28160,0,century
28161,0,kirk hears what picard is saying but like picard in
28162,0,his fantasy he is more interested in the sights and
28163,0,sounds around him a dog barks from oc they both
28164,0,look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
28165,0,kirk with enthusiasm
28166,0,kirk
28167,0,affectionately
28168,0,jake jake you miserable old
28169,0,mutt how can you be here
28170,0,to picard

28172,0,kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we
28173,0,hear a womans voice from somewhere upstairs that
28174,0,stops kirk in his tracks as she speaks we can see
28175,0,the shock on kirks face
28176,0,antonias voice
28177,0,come on jim im starving how

28184,0,kirk looks at the food on the stove hes beginning to
28185,0,realize something
28186,0,kirk
28187,0,wait a minute
28188,0,kirk glances at picard
28189,0,kirk
28190,0,the future what are you
28191,0,talking about this is the
28192,0,past
28193,0,kirk moves to a drawer and opens it inside is a
28194,0,horseshoe with a tiny red bow tied to it this
28195,0,confirms things for kirk he picks up the horseshoe
28196,0,kirk
28197,0,this is nine years ago the day
28198,0,i told her i was going back to
28199,0,starfleet
28200,0,kirk is swept up in the moment overwhelmed by
28201,0,memories sensations feelings he goes back to the
28202,0,frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden
28203,0,burst of recognition
28204,0,kirk
28205,0,these were ktarian eggs her
28206,0,favoritei was cooking them to
28207,0,soften the blow

28213,0,you but its not this isnt
28214,0,really your house weve both
28215,0,been caught up in some sort of
28216,0,temporal nexus
28217,0,but kirks mind is clearly elsewhere hes being
28218,0,swept away by the emotion of the moment realizing the
28219,0,opportunity he suddenly has
28220,0,kirk
28221,0,dill weed
28222,0,kirk indicates a shelf as if asking picard to go to
28223,0,it
28224,0,kirk
28225,0,theres a bottle of dill weed on
28226,0,the second shelf to the left
28227,0,right behind the nutmeg
28228,0,kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs
28229,0,he cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins
28230,0,preparing a breakfast picard waits for a moment then
28231,0,goes to the shelf grabs the dill weed and hands it
28232,0,to kirk
28233,0,picard
28234,0,how long have you been here

28242,0,breakfast tray picard is getting a little impatient
28243,0,but stirs the eggs anyway
28244,0,kirk
28245,0,continuing
28246,0,the bulkhead in front of me
28247,0,disappeared then i was out
28248,0,there chopping wood
28249,0,back to stove
28250,0,thanks
28251,0,kirk takes the pan of eggs back from picard
28252,0,picard
28253,0,history records that you died
28254,0,saving the enterpriseb from an
28255,0,energy ribbon eighty years ago
28256,0,but picards words mean almost nothing to kirk he is
28257,0,thoroughly enjoying himself and picard is almost a
28258,0,distraction kirk begins serving the eggs onto the
28259,0,plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
28260,0,tray
28261,0,kirk
28262,0,amused
28263,0,so youre telling me this is the

28270,0,kirk
28271,0,temporal nexus yeah i heard you
28272,0,frowns at tray
28273,0,somethings missing
28274,0,then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster
28275,0,as if on cue two slices of toast pop out kirk grins
28276,0,and puts the toast on the plates kirk picks up the
28277,0,tray and heads for the door
28278,0,picard
28279,0,captain i need your help i want
28280,0,you to leave the nexus with me
28281,0,kirk goes out of the kitchen and picard follows
28282,0,int kirks home living room day continuous
28283,0,kirk and picard both on the move kirk heading for a
28284,0,staircase
28285,0,picard
28286,0,we have to go back to a planet
28287,0,called veridian iii and stop a
28288,0,man from destroying a star there
28289,0,are millions of lives at stake
28290,0,kirk tries to keep it light hoping this man will go
28291,0,away
28292,0,kirk
28293,0,you said history considers me
28294,0,dead who am i to argue with
28295,0,history

28297,0,youre a starfleet officer and you
28298,0,have a duty to
28299,0,kirk

28302,0,you i was out saving the galaxy
28303,0,when your grandfather was still in
28304,0,diapers and frankly i think the

28306,0,beat
28307,0,i was like you once so worried
28308,0,about duty and obligations that i
28309,0,couldnt see anything past this
28310,0,uniform and in the end what did
28311,0,it get me nothing not this
28312,0,time
28313,0,kirk brushes past picard and stops at the foot of the
28314,0,stairs
28315,0,kirk
28316,0,looking up the stairs
28317,0,im going to walk up these stairs
28318,0,march into that bedroom and tell
28319,0,antonia that i want to marry her
28320,0,kirk begins to climb the stairs
28321,0,kirk
28322,0,this time things are going to be
28323,0,different
28324,0,he goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind
28325,0,him picard glances around the room in frustration
28326,0,then gets a determined look on his face and marches up
28327,0,the stairs after kirk grasps the doorknob opens it
28328,0,and steps through the door into
28329,0,int barn day continuous
28330,0,picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
28331,0,of a wooden barn straw on the floor farm
28332,0,implements on the walls sunlight streaming in
28333,0,through the slats there are stalls in the barn with
28334,0,a few horses visible
28335,0,kirk is standing a short distance away he looks
28336,0,surprised as well and he is no longer holding the
28337,0,tray of food
28338,0,picard
28339,0,re barn
28340,0,this doesnt look like your
28341,0,bedroom
28342,0,kirk looks around for a moment the pieces starting to
28343,0,fall into place he smiles with a growing
28344,0,realization
28345,0,kirk
28346,0,no no its not its better
28347,0,picard
28348,0,better
28349,0,kirk
28350,0,this is my uncles barn in iowa
28351,0,he points to a horse with a saddle on it
28352,0,kirk
28353,0,re horse
28354,0,i took that horse out for a ride
28355,0,seven years ago on a spring
28356,0,day
28357,0,kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a
28358,0,beautiful spring day
28359,0,
28360,0,kirk
28361,0,just like this if im right
28362,0,this is the day i met antonia
28363,0,he turns to picard
28364,0,kirk
28365,0,this nexus of yours is very
28366,0,clever i can start all over
28367,0,again do things right from day
28368,0,one
28369,0,kirk grabs the horse swings up onto the saddle and
28370,0,rides out of the barn filled with excitement picard
28371,0,watches him for a moment then looks at one of the
28372,0,other horses in the barn he makes a decision and
28373,0,then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall
28374,0,
28375,0,cut to
28376,0,ext countryside day vfxp
28377,0,kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside
28378,0,and across a stream through a thicket of trees and
28379,0,finally out onto a rolling plain there is a large
28380,0,ravine up ahead kirk sees it and smiles tightly he
28381,0,spurs his horse faster toward the ravine the horse
28382,0,is tearing along comes up to the edge of the
28383,0,precipice and makes a daring leap to the other side
28384,0,
28385,0,horse and rider land together and kirk spurs the horse
28386,0,on but as he rides we begin to see a change come
28387,0,over him a look of doubt crosses his face
28388,0,somethings not right he slows the horse to a trot
28389,0,and then to a complete stop he sits there for a
28390,0,moment and frowns turns and looks back at the
28391,0,ravine which is now a fair distance away something
28392,0,about that jump is nagging at him
28393,0,he turns his horse around and then digs in his heels
28394,0,the horse breaks into a gallop racing back toward the
28395,0,ravine
28396,0,kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the
28397,0,horse makes the leap across yet again
28398,0,this time when kirk lands he brings his horse to an
28399,0,immediate stop we can see on his face that something
28400,0,is very wrong he turns and stares at the ravine with
28401,0,a mixture of shock and sadness on his face
28402,0,in the distance picard can be seen approaching on a
28403,0,horse of his own he stops next to kirk there is a
28404,0,long quiet moment as the two men sit there side by
28405,0,side kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
28406,0,feelings
28407,0,kirk
28408,0,re ravine
28409,0,i must have made this jump fifty
28410,0,times and every time it scared
28411,0,the hell out of me but not this
28412,0,time
28413,0,beat
28414,0,because its not real
28415,0,a quiet beat kirk turns and looks toward a particular
28416,0,hill in the distance shading his eyes against the
28417,0,bright sun picard follows his gaze and we can now see
28418,0,the distant figure of a woman walking her horse
28419,0,
28420,0,picard
28421,0,re woman
28422,0,antonia
28423,0,kirk
28424,0,nods
28425,0,shes not real either is she
28426,0,nothing here is nothing here
28427,0,matters
28428,0,all euphoria is now gone from kirk its a moment of
28429,0,selfrevelation he glances around
28430,0,kirk
28431,0,its kinda like orbital
28432,0,skydiving exciting for a few
28433,0,minutes but in the end you
28434,0,havent really done anything
28435,0,you havent made a difference
28436,0,kirk takes a beat then looks at picard and in a way
28437,0,hes truly seeing him for the first time
28438,0,kirk
28439,0,captain of the enterprise huh
28440,0,picard
28441,0,thats right
28442,0,kirk
28443,0,close to retirement
28444,0,picard
28445,0,i hadnt planned on it
28446,0,there is a passion and a fervor in kirk that we havent
28447,0,seen until now
28448,0,kirk
28449,0,well let me tell you something
28450,0,dont dont let them promote
28451,0,you dont let them transfer
28452,0,you dont let anything take you
28453,0,off the bridge of that ship
28454,0,beat
28455,0,because while youre there you
28456,0,can make a difference
28457,0,the two captains face each other for a moment picard
28458,0,hears what kirk is saying but also knows thats not the
28459,0,whole story picard gives him a direct look and there
28460,0,is something in picards eyes a glint of resolve and
28461,0,determination
28462,0,picard
28463,0,you dont need to be on the bridge
28464,0,of a starship come with me
28465,0,help me stop soran
28466,0,beat
28467,0,make a difference again
28468,0,a long silent beat as kirk considers picard and slowly
28469,0,unexpectedly a smile spreads across his face
28470,0,kirk
28471,0,how can i argue with the captain
28472,0,of the enterprise
28473,0,a beat
28474,0,what was the name of that
28475,0,planet veridian iii
28476,0,picard
28477,0,thats right
28478,0,kirk
28479,0,i take it the odds are against us
28480,0,and the situation is grim
28481,0,picard
28482,0,you could say that
28483,0,kirk
28484,0,musing
28485,0,of course if spock were here
28486,0,hed say i was being an
28487,0,irrational illogical human for
28488,0,wanting to go on a mission like
28489,0,that
28490,0,and for the first time we can see the twinkle in his
28491,0,eye that tells us jim kirk is back
28492,0,kirk
28493,0,sounds like fun
28494,0,the two men turn and walk away from antoniaand as
28495,0,they walk a roar of color and sound washes out the
28496,0,screen as seen before
28497,0,fade to red
28498,0,fade in
28499,0,ext mountaintop day vfxp
28500,0,soran is standing in front of the forcefield facing

28504,0,i have an appointment with
28505,0,eternity and i dont want to be

28508,0,again
28509,0,soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding
28510,0,toward the top of the rock face picard drops to the
28511,0,ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath
28512,0,the forcefield picard accidentally touches the
28513,0,field
28514,0,a soran vfxp a
28515,0,turns at the sound of the field sees picard and then

28518,0,is blasted apart creating a cloud of dirt and debris
28519,0,obscuring picard and the whole area momentarily
28520,0,soran jumps down one level his disruptor still in his
28521,0,hand ready just in case picard somehow survived
28522,0,soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris
28523,0,
28524,0,the dust clears but picard is gone along with
28525,0,several feet of the ground where he was crawling
28526,0,c soran vfxi c
28527,0,soran glances up at the sky and sees the energy ribbon

28538,0,kirk fights with soran handtohand brutal
28539,0,picard works the control panel trying to make sense

31177,0,you take his sight away from him
31178,0,picard
31179,0,there are metaphasic particles

31187,0,it i only know they inject
31188,0,something into the rings that
31189,0,starts a thermolytic reaction
31190,0,after its over the planet will
31191,0,be unlivable for generations
31192,0,picard

31197,0,have we cant find any other

33896,0,picard
33897,0,i understand why it would seem
33898,0,confusing certain human
33899,0,rituals like weddings
33900,0,birthdays or funerals evoke
33901,0,strong and very complex
33902,0,emotions these rites carry

34909,0,romulus
34910,0,picard
34911,0,im afraid the opal sea will
34912,0,have to wait number one
34913,0,engage
34914,0,ext enterprise space
34915,0,and the enterprise jumps to high warp disappear

34919,0,monitors currently show an image of romulus and
34920,0,remus in orbit around their sun
34921,0,data
34922,0,as you can see the habitable
34923,0,half of remus is always in
34924,0,darkness because like
34925,0,mercury one side always
34926,0,faces the sun due to the
34927,0,extreme temperatures on that
34928,0,half of their world the
34929,0,remans live on the dark side
34930,0,of the planet
34931,0,various grainy and unclear new images appear to
34932,0,illustrate data s words
34933,0,data
34934,0,almost nothing is known about
34935,0,the reman homeworld although
34936,0,intelligence scans have
34937,0,proven the existence of
34938,0,dilithium mining and heavy
34939,0,weapons construction
34940,0,very obscure images of remans appear the crew can
34941,0,barely make out the monstrous figures
34942,0,data
34943,0,the remans themselves are
34944,0,considered an undesirable
34945,0,caste in the hierarchy of the
34946,0,empire
34947,0,riker
34948,0,but they also have the
34949,0,reputation of being formidable
34950,0,warriors in the dominion war
34951,0,reman forces were used as
34952,0,assault troops in the most
34953,0,violent encounters
34954,0,picard
34955,0,grim
34956,0,cannon fodder
34957,0,geordi
34958,0,then how did a reman get to
34959,0,be praetor i dont get it
34960,0,riker
34961,0,we have to assume he had
34962,0,romulan collaborators
34963,0,picard
34964,0,a coup detat
34965,0,riker
34966,0,the praetors power has always
34967,0,been the romulan fleet they
34968,0,must be behind him
34969,0,picard considers this
34970,0,picard
34971,0,to data
34972,0,what have you learned about
34973,0,shinzon
34974,0,the images end there are no images of shinzon
34975,0,data
34976,0,starfleet intelligence was
34977,0,only able to provide a partial
34978,0,account of his military
34979,0,record we can infer he is
34980,0,relatively young and a
34981,0,capablecommander he fought
34982,0,seventeen major engagements
34983,0,in the war all successful
34984,0,beyond that we know nothing
34985,0,picard
34986,0,well it seems were truly
34987,0,sailing into the unknown
34988,0,keep at it anything you can
34989,0,give me would be appreciated
34990,0,dismissed
34991,0,the meeting breaks up

34993,0,the b stares placidly forward

34998,0,at present he serves no useful

35000,0,to become active and useful
35001,0,members of society i do not
35002,0,believe he would have wanted
35003,0,the b to live out his life
35004,0,in his present state
35005,0,geordi
35006,0,i cant believe the captain
35007,0,went along with a memory
35008,0,download
35009,0,data
35010,0,captain picard agrees that the
35011,0,b was probably designed with
35012,0,the same selfactualization
35013,0,parameters as myself if my
35014,0,memory engrams are successfully
35015,0,integrated into his positronic
35016,0,matrix he should have all my
35017,0,abilities
35018,0,geordi
35019,0,hed have all your memories
35020,0,too you feel comfortable with
35021,0,that
35022,0,data
35023,0,i feel nothing geordi it is
35024,0,my belief that with my memory
35025,0,engrams he will be able to
35026,0,function as a more complete
35027,0,individual
35028,0,geordi
35029,0,an individual more like you
35030,0,you mean
35031,0,data
35032,0,yes
35033,0,geordi
35034,0,maybe hes not supposed to be
35035,0,like you maybe hes supposed
35036,0,to be just like he is
35037,0,geordi completes his work
35038,0,geordi
35039,0,okay were done
35040,0,geordi removes the computer connections from

35058,0,no
35059,0,data
35060,0,is that your final answer
35061,0,geordi
35062,0,to b
35063,0,do you know my name

35065,0,you have a soft voice

35067,0,gently
35068,0,data hes assimilating a lot
35069,0,of programming e member hes
35070,0,a prototype a lot less
35071,0,sophisticated than you are we
35072,0,just dont know if his matrix
35073,0,will be able to adapt or if
35074,0,hell be able to retain any
35075,0,thing we should give him
35076,0,some time
35077,0,data has been studying some circuitry in the bs
35078,0,neck
35079,0,data
35080,0,what purpose does this serve
35081,0,geordi
35082,0,also examining
35083,0,circuitry
35084,0,it seems to be a redundant
35085,0,memory port maybe its for

35087,0,case his neural pathways
35088,0,overload
35089,0,data
35090,0,dr soong must have found it
35091,0,unnecessary in later versions
35092,0,geordi
35093,0,its possible the extra memory
35094,0,port is interfering with the
35095,0,engram processing mind if i
35096,0,keep him here and run some
35097,0,diagnostics
35098,0,data
35099,0,no i do not mind
35100,0,data looks at the b with a sort of sadness
35101,0,data
35102,0,but i believe he will prove

35218,0,he stands on the scimitars bridge the bridge is
35219,0,as unique as the rest of shinzons ship instead of

35221,0,designed with an almost asian simplicity like the
35222,0,rest of reman design it is spare and elegant
35223,0,since the remans are more comfortable in the dark
35224,0,ness most of the light comes from the three

35257,0,simple reman mat on the floor is the only

35270,0,more illuminated the low light shining off his
35271,0,golden hair
35272,0,the crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light
35273,0,but it is evident he is human assuming that he
35274,0,was reman they re surprised by this realization
35275,0,shinzon just stares at picard through the darkness
35276,0,for a moment

35343,0,federation i suggest you do
35344,0,so now
35345,0,shinzon continues to stare at deanna it is
35346,0,strangely seductive almost disquieting in its
35347,0,intensity deanna handles it with grace her level
35348,0,gaze never leaving his
35349,0,shinzon
35350,0,softly
35351,0,on the world i come from
35352,0,theres no light no sun

35356,0,praetor shinzon we re not
35357,0,here to discuss your lack of
35358,0,a social life
35359,0,shinzon
35360,0,turning back to
35361,0,picard
35362,0,yes im sorry captain

35364,0,theres so much we have to
35365,0,talk about

35367,0,i would be interested to know
35368,0,what we are talking about
35369,0,shinzon
35370,0,unity captain tearing down
35371,0,the walls between us to
35372,0,recognize we are one people
35373,0,federation and romulan human
35374,0,and vulcan and klingon and
35375,0,reman im speaking of the
35376,0,thing that makes us the same
35377,0,we want peace
35378,0,picard and the others are stunned
35379,0,shinzon
35380,0,i want to end the centuries
35381,0,of mistrust i want to be your
35382,0,ally not your enemy as a
35383,0,first step i propose we
35384,0,eliminate the neutral zone
35385,0,and begin a free and open
35386,0,exchange of goods and ideas
35387,0,picard
35388,0,and the senate supports you
35389,0,shinzon
35390,0,dry
35391,0,i have dissolved the senate
35392,0,a beat
35393,0,shinzon
35394,0,right now you re thinking
35395,0,this all sounds too good to
35396,0,be true
35397,0,picard
35398,0,yes
35399,0,shinzon
35400,0,and youre wondering why the
35401,0,scimitar is so well armed is
35402,0,this the ship of a peacemaker
35403,0,or a predator
35404,0,picard is startled at shinzons choice of words
35405,0,shinzon
35406,0,contd
35407,0,but youre also thinking the
35408,0,chance for peace is too
35409,0,promising to ignore above
35410,0,allyoure trying to decide if
35411,0,you can trust me
35412,0,picard
35413,0,yes
35414,0,shinzon
35415,0,then perhaps the time has
35416,0,come to add some illumination
35417,0,to our discussion computer
35418,0,raise lighting four levels
35419,0,lights shoot up around the room
35420,0,for the first time the crew can see shinzon
35421,0,clearly picard actually gasps when he sees
35422,0,shinzons face the rest of the crew doesnt
35423,0,understand his reaction
35424,0,shinzon
35425,0,allow me to tell you a story
35426,0,that i hope will clarify my
35427,0,position when i was very
35428,0,young i was stricken with an
35429,0,odd disease i developed a
35430,0,hypersensitivity to sound
35431,0,the slightest whisper caused
35432,0,me agony
35433,0,picard watches him carefully wary and strangely
35434,0,intense
35435,0,shinzon
35436,0,no one knew what to do
35437,0,finally i was taken to a
35438,0,doctor who had some experience
35439,0,with terran illnesses and i
35440,0,was finally diagnosed with
35441,0,shalafts syndrome do you
35442,0,know of it captain
35443,0,picard
35444,0,you know i do
35445,0,the crew is dumbfounded at picards unusual
35446,0,reaction
35447,0,shinzon
35448,0,then you know its a very
35449,0,rare syndrome genetic all
35450,0,the male members of my family
35451,0,had it eventually i was
35452,0,treated now i can hear as
35453,0,well as you can captain
35454,0,he steps toward picard who holds his ground
35455,0,shinzon
35456,0,i can see as well as you can
35457,0,i can feel everything you
35458,0,feel
35459,0,he stops right before picard
35460,0,shinzon
35461,0,contd
35462,0,in fact i feel exactly what
35463,0,you feel dont i jean luc
35464,0,picard stares at him with a mixture of realization
35465,0,and curiosity it is as if picard is looking into
35466,0,a strange remembered mirror shinzons face is
35467,0,nearly identical to his at that age
35468,0,shinzon
35469,0,do you trust me now
35470,0,a beat
35471,0,picard
35472,0,we need to talk just you and

35478,0,picard

35480,0,this
35481,0,shinzon
35482,0,i know
35483,0,the crew is utterly confused their confusion turns
35484,0,to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a
35485,0,reman knife and cuts his arm drawing a little
35486,0,blood he hands the knife to data
35487,0,shinzon
35488,0,tomorrow then captain we
35489,0,have so much to discuss

35514,0,picard

35954,0,i thought thalaron radiation
35955,0,was theoretical
35956,0,geordi
35957,0,which is why our initial scans
35958,0,didnt pick it up but hes
35959,0,got it captain
35960,0,picard
35961,0,as i remember thalaron
35962,0,research was banned in the
35963,0,federation because of its
35964,0,bioqenic properties
35965,0,beverly
35966,0,it has the ability to consume
35967,0,organic material at the
35968,0,subatomic level i cant
35969,0,overestimate the danger of
35970,0,thalaron radiation jean luc
35971,0,a microscopic amount could
35972,0,kill every living thing on
35973,0,this ship in a matter of
35974,0,seconds
35975,0,picard
35976,0,understood keep on it i

36235,0,went to a great deal of
36236,0,trouble to find it and
36237,0,scatter it about on kolarus
36238,0,iii i knew it would pique
36239,0,your curiosity and conven
36240,0,iently make the enterprise
36241,0,the closest ship to romulus
36242,0,when i contacted starfleet
36243,0,the reman doctor leaves the cell the force field is
36244,0,reactivated the doctor goes to the mysterious
36245,0,medical apparatus and analyzes picards blood as
36246,0,picard
36247,0,all of this so you could
36248,0,capture me
36249,0,shinzon
36250,0,dont be so vain after we
36251,0,found it we made a few
36252,0,modifications an extra memory
36253,0,port a hidden transponder
36254,0,perhaps your eyes will be a
36255,0,bit less confident when you
36256,0,learn ive gained access to
36257,0,starfleets communications
36258,0,protocols i now know the
36259,0,location of your entire
36260,0,fleet
36261,0,to b
36262,0,you may go
36263,0,b
36264,0,where
36265,0,shinzon
36266,0,out of my sight
36267,0,the b obediently leaves the room as
36268,0,shinzon
36269,0,maybe ill train it to do
36270,0,little tricks for me like your
36271,0,robot does or maybe i ll
36272,0,snap its ugly head off
36273,0,picard
36274,0,whats this all about
36275,0,shinzon
36276,0,its about destiny picard
36277,0,about a reman outcast who
36278,0,picard
36279,0,youre not reman
36280,0,shinzon
36281,0,and im not quite human so
36282,0,what am i what do you see
36283,0,peering at picard
36284,0,deeply
36285,0,do you see a life you might
36286,0,have led lost youth never
36287,0,to be recaptured
36288,0,picard
36289,0,i see a young man trying
36290,0,desperately to deny who he is
36291,0,shinzon
36292,0,i see an old man set in his
36293,0,ways afraid to live without
36294,0,a uniform to prop him up and
36295,0,a starfleet regulation to
36296,0,tell him what to do i see
36297,0,the man i will never be
36298,0,picard
36299,0,i wont defend my life to you
36300,0,shinzon
36301,0,my life is meaningless as
36302,0,long as youre alive what am
36303,0,i while you exist a shadow
36304,0,an enigma
36305,0,picard
36306,0,stern
36307,0,if your issues are with me
36308,0,this has nothing to do with
36309,0,my ship and nothing to do
36310,0,with the federation
36311,0,shinzon
36312,0,oh but it does we will no
36313,0,longer bow like slaves before
36314,0,anyone not the romulans and
36315,0,not your mighty federation
36316,0,were a race bred for war
36317,0,for conquest
36318,0,picard
36319,0,think about what youre doing
36320,0,shinzon are you ready to
36321,0,plunge the entire quadrant
36322,0,into war to satisfy your own
36323,0,personal demons
36324,0,shinzon
36325,0,it amazes me how little you
36326,0,know yourself
36327,0,picard
36328,0,im incapable of such an act
36329,0,and so are you
36330,0,shinzon
36331,0,i think the facts speak for
36332,0,themselves the same noble
36333,0,picard blood runs in our
36334,0,veins had you lived my life
36335,0,youd be doing exactly as i
36336,0,am look in the mirror and
36337,0,see yourself
36338,0,shinzon looks at him deeply
36339,0,shinzon
36340,0,consider that captain i can
36341,0,think of no greater i torment
36342,0,for you
36343,0,he turns to go
36344,0,picard
36345,0,its a mirror for you as well
36346,0,shinzon turns back to him
36347,0,a beat picard gazes at him evenly
36348,0,picards probing gaze makes shinzon a bit uneasy he
36349,0,glances to the ghoulish medical preparations
36350,0,shinzon
36351,0,not for long captain
36352,0,back to picard
36353,0,im afraid you wont survive
36354,0,to witness the victory of the
36355,0,echo over the voice

36418,0,a small and weak creature
36419,0,yet he roars so valiantly

36421,0,on picards chest
36422,0,viceroy
36423,0,contd
36424,0,it would take me but an
36425,0,instant to tear that valiant
36426,0,heart from your chest

36440,0,the viceroy continues away down the corridor the b
36441,0,leads picard along
36442,0,picard
36443,0,whispers
36444,0,be careful of overplaying
36445,0,your part commander
36446,0,and the audience now realizes it is data pretending
36447,0,to be the b and rejoices
36448,0,data
36449,0,sorry sir i thought it
36450,0,added a touch of reality to
36451,0,the performance
36452,0,they are silent as they pass a few reman guards then
36453,0,data
36454,0,my mission was a success
36455,0,sir i have discovered the
36456,0,source of the thalaron
36457,0,radiation
36458,0,picard
36459,0,good work the download
36460,0,data
36461,0,he believes he has our
36462,0,communications protocols but
36463,0,they will give him inaccurate
36464,0,locations for all starfleet
36465,0,vessels
36466,0,data assumes the bs posture again as they pass some
36467,0,reman warriors
36468,0,data
36469,0,move puny human animal
36470,0,they pass the warriors
36471,0,picard
36472,0,a bit less florid data
36473,0,data
36474,0,aye sir this way
36475,0,he leads picard down the corridor
36476,0,int scimitar generation chamber night
36477,0,data leads picard into a massive chamber that soars
36478,0,up like a cathedral it is the size of a small town
36479,0,the whole cavernous chamber pulses with glowing
36480,0,green light
36481,0,data
36482,0,this entire ship is
36483,0,essentially a flying
36484,0,thalaron generator
36485,0,pointing up
36486,0,all its power relays lead to
36487,0,that device
36488,0,high above them at the very top of the chamber is
36489,0,a gigantic version of the spiderweapon we saw kill
36490,0,all the romulan senators before it is breathtaking
36491,0,picard
36492,0,a weapon
36493,0,data
36494,0,it would appear so
36495,0,data rotates his left hand and then slides it
36496,0,forward exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist
36497,0,he removes a small silver disc this is a cool new
36498,0,piece of federation technology called an etu
36499,0,emergency transport unit
36500,0,data
36501,0,geordi equipped me with the
36502,0,prototype for the emergency
36503,0,transport unit i recommend
36504,0,you use it to return to the
36505,0,enterprise
36506,0,picard
36507,0,itll only work for one of us
36508,0,data
36509,0,yes sir
36510,0,picard
36511,0,well find a way off together
36512,0,recommendations
36513,0,data
36514,0,there is a shuttlebay
36515,0,meters from our current
36516,0,location
36517,0,data inserts the etu back into his wrist and they
36518,0,leave the chamber
36519,0,int scimitar bridge night
36520,0,
36521,0,the viceroy arrives on the bridge stops
36522,0,viceroy
36523,0,wheres picard
36524,0,shinzon looks at him confused
36525,0,int scimitar corridors night
36526,0,security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and
36527,0,harsh reman commands are broadcast through the
36528,0,corridors
36529,0,data
36530,0,this way sir
36531,0,they sprint down the twisting dark corridors
36532,0,reman warriors suddenly appear before them data
36533,0,fires the disruptor as picard launches himself into
36534,0,them
36535,0,a fight picard uses a dazzlinq series of starfleet
36536,0,handtohand maneuvers he dramatically subdues
36537,0,the remans
36538,0,more reman warriors appear down the corridor picard
36539,0,grabs a disruptor
36540,0,and instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor a
36541,0,battle break out in the corridor the energy beams
36542,0,and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight
36543,0,in strobelike bursts
36544,0,they run to another corridor and finally arrive at
36545,0,the shuttlebay door it does not open
36546,0,data
36547,0,looking at door
36548,0,security panel
36549,0,it seems to have an encrypted
36550,0,security system
36551,0,reman warriors are closing in on them
36552,0,data tosses his disruptor to picard picard catches
36553,0,it and instantly spins and fires he uses both
36554,0,disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor
36555,0,like a western sheriff keeping the remans at bay
36556,0,as data uses both hands to punch numbers into the
36557,0,shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate
36558,0,picard
36559,0,alacrity would be appreciated
36560,0,commander
36561,0,data
36562,0,they are trying to override
36563,0,the access codes reman is
36564,0,really a most complex language
36565,0,with pictographs representing
36566,0,certain verb roots and
36567,0,picard
36568,0,while i find that fascinating
36569,0,data we really need that
36570,0,goddamned door open
36571,0,the shuttlebay door slides open
36572,0,picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire
36573,0,as he and data duck into the shuttlebay
36574,0,int scimitar shuttlebay following
36575,0,when the door closes behind them picard turns and
36576,0,fires a disruptor blast sealing the door
36577,0,mechanism
36578,0,they turn to face
36579,0,a fleet of very small shuttles they are uniquely
36580,0,designed extremely compact and streamlined a
36581,0,disruptor turret on each
36582,0,they move toward one as
36583,0,data
36584,0,according to the ships
36585,0,manifest they are scorpion
36586,0,class attack fliers
36587,0,they quickly climb a scorpion
36588,0,int scorpion cockpit shuttlebay following
36589,0,the cockpit of the scorpion is cramped picard
36590,0,climbs into the pilots position data assumes the
36591,0,gunners position
36592,0,they see disruptor fire trying to burn through the
36593,0,door to the shuttlebay picard powers up the
36594,0,scorpion as
36595,0,picard is trying to figure out the controls
36596,0,picard
36597,0,what do you imagine this is
36598,0,data
36599,0,port thrusters sir would you
36600,0,like me to drive
36601,0,picard shoots him a look and presses some controls
36602,0,the scorpion lifts off hovers a few feet over the
36603,0,deck picard elegantly swings it around toward the
36604,0,large shuttlebay external doors as
36605,0,picard
36606,0,can you open the shuttlebay
36607,0,doors
36608,0,data
36609,0,working controls
36610,0,affirmative sir negative
36611,0,sir they have instigated
36612,0,security overrides and erected
36613,0,a force field around the
36614,0,external portals
36615,0,picard
36616,0,well then only one way to
36617,0,go
36618,0,he swings the scorpion around again so it is facing
36619,0,the doors they came through the doors back into the
36620,0,ship
36621,0,data is dubious
36622,0,data
36623,0,do you think this is a wise
36624,0,course of action
36625,0,picard
36626,0,were about to find out
36627,0,power up disruptors and fire
36628,0,on my mark

36633,0,and the scorpions forward disruptors fire the
36634,0,doors into the ship explode picard powers forward
36635,0,int scimitar corridors following
36636,0,and the scorpion shoots into the corridor past the
36637,0,stunned remans picard banks sharply careens off
36638,0,the far side of the corridor but keeps control
36639,0,the scorpion zooms down the corridor
36640,0,int scorpion cockpit scimitar following
36641,0,picard is concentrating intensely it is like trying
36642,0,to control the worlds fastest roller coaster
36643,0,int scimitar corridors following
36644,0,the scorpion banks around a corner it zigs and
36645,0,zags through the ship at breakneck speed
36646,0,int scimitar observation lounge night
36647,0,the doors to the observation lounge explode in
36648,0,the scorpion shoots into the room and up
36649,0,a disruptor blast shatters the etched glass dome at
36650,0,the top of the room
36651,0,and the scorpion zooms triumphantly into space
36652,0,ext over romulus space
36653,0,
36654,0,the scorpion seems to appear from nowhere slicing
36655,0,through the cloak of invisibility around the scimitar
36656,0,int enterprise bridge following
36657,0,
36658,0,the crew sees the scorpion appear on the viewscreen

36683,0,veined now
36684,0,shinzon
36685,0,the enterprise is immaterial
36686,0,they wont make it back to
36687,0,federation space
36688,0,suran
36689,0,angry on viewscreen
36690,0,this has gone far enough
36691,0,shinzon
36692,0,i thought we discussed
36693,0,patience commander
36694,0,suran
36695,0,on viewscreen
36696,0,and mine is wearing thin
36697,0,young man we supported you
36698,0,because you promised action
36699,0,and yet you delay and you
36700,0,waste your time playing games
36701,0,with picard while
36702,0,shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform
36703,0,tunic exactly as weve seen picard do a thousand
36704,0,times
36705,0,shinzon
36706,0,commander suran the games are
36707,0,over in two days the
36708,0,federation will be crippled
36709,0,beyond repair does that
36710,0,satisfy you
36711,0,suran
36712,0,grim on viewscreen
36713,0,for the moment
36714,0,shinzon
36715,0,brutal
36716,0,and when i return you and
36717,0,i shall have a little talk

36744,0,you truly want romulans
36745,0,a beat
36746,0,donatra
36747,0,i think you should consider

36754,0,beverly sits with picard and riker
36755,0,beverly
36756,0,the more i studied his dna the
36757,0,more confusing it got finally
36758,0,i could only come to one
36759,0,conclusion shinzon was
36760,0,created with temporal rna
36761,0,sequencing he was designed
36762,0,so that at a certain point his
36763,0,aging process could be
36764,0,accelerated to reach your age
36765,0,more quickly so he could
36766,0,replace you
36767,0,picard
36768,0,but the romulans abandoned the
36769,0,plan
36770,0,beverly
36771,0,as a result the temporal
36772,0,sequencing was never activated
36773,0,remember he was supposed to
36774,0,replace you at nearly your
36775,0,current age he was engineered
36776,0,to skip thirty years of life
36777,0,but since the rna sequencing
36778,0,was never activated his
36779,0,cellular structure has started
36780,0,to break down hes dying
36781,0,picard
36782,0,dying
36783,0,riker
36784,0,he wasnt designed to live a
36785,0,complete human life span
36786,0,picard
36787,0,can anything be done for him
36788,0,beverly
36789,0,not without a complete
36790,0,myelodysplastic infusion from
36791,0,the only donor with compatible
36792,0,dna but that would mean
36793,0,draining all your blood
36794,0,riker
36795,0,thats why he went to all that
36796,0,trouble to capture you
36797,0,picard
36798,0,how long does he have
36799,0,beverly
36800,0,i cant be sure but the rate
36801,0,of decay seems to be
36802,0,accelerating
36803,0,picard considers this

38476,0,stretches to infinity a storm of dust gathers on the

38495,0,in vain for water there are many hundreds
38496,0,of holes in the earth around him
38497,0,jonn reacts to the clop of approaching hooves he

38506,0,impatiently while the rider studies the frightened
38507,0,homesteader and removes a breathing device from his
38508,0,mouth finally he speaks
38509,0,rider
38510,0,i thought weapons were forbiddeen on

38520,0,pathetic
38521,0,its all i have
38522,0,jonn sags under the futile weight of his existence
38523,0,the rider approaches him without fear he gently
38524,0,removes the weapon from jonns trembling hands its
38525,0,all the homesteader can do to keep from sobbing
38526,0,rider
38527,0,your pain runs deep

38547,0,catharis ends jonn drops to his knees then looks up
38548,0,he opens his eyes and blinks in wonder and amazement
38549,0,at the rider the rider helps him to his feet
38550,0,jonn
38551,0,as if reborn
38552,0,where did you get this power
38553,0,rider
38554,0,the power was within you

42779,0,and dust covered are that of a vulcan aspirant in

42816,0,intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck
42817,0,but spock now hesitates hes troubled as though
42818,0,uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the
42819,0,pendant away then a faint reprise of the vger theme
42820,0,music now causes the female master to look skyward
42821,0,she turns from this back to spock as she exchanges a
42822,0,look with the male masters

42824,0,gestures spock forward

43229,0,the entire complex a beehive of predeparture activity
43230,0,engineering personnel at least a third of them female
43231,0,coming and going the platformelevators small one
43232,0,man lifts to various levels busy a gentle but con

43234,0,cate a preidling mode there will be continual ad
43235,0,libbed conversation among the technicians
43236,0,now the engine room door opens and kirk steps into the
43237,0,area he stands a moment observing the activity a
43238,0,grizzled engineering chief pushes a huge condenser on
43239,0,an antigrav device past irk with a respectful watch
43240,0,it sir admonishment kirk moves on to
43241,0,the intermix chamber
43242,0,at the middle of the power shaft very noisy here
43243,0,and a continual cacophony of computerized and human
43244,0,voices calling off equipment checks and grouped
43245,0,around a section of burntout circuitry are willard
43246,0,decker captains stripes handsome in his early
43247,0,s scott and two technicians decker and scott
43248,0,are working feverishly uncoupling the device
43249,0,probing its innards decker has discovered the problem
43250,0,removed several transistortype parts taps them
43251,0,with a pencilsized sonic analyzer
43252,0,decker
43253,0,quietly elated
43254,0,i thought so see the trans
43255,0,porter sensor was not activated
43256,0,scott
43257,0,impressed
43258,0,aye you were dead right about
43259,0,that
43260,0,to technician
43261,0,clearly put a backup sensor into
43262,0,the unit
43263,0,across them to kirk
43264,0,as the technician prepares to install the device
43265,0,scott glances up to see kirk
43266,0,he looks from decker to kirk in acute embarrassment
43267,0,so that we should realize scott hasnt mentioned
43268,0,kirks taking over to decker decker now notices
43269,0,kirk reacts pleased

43292,0,as scott ad libs a glum aye sir and watches them
43293,0,walk across the chamber
43294,0,a corner of the intermix chamber
43295,0,just a little quieter here with kirk and decker arriv
43296,0,ing and decker saying blithely
43297,0,decker
43298,0,all due respect sir i hope
43299,0,this isnt a starfleet pep talk
43300,0,im just too busy
43301,0,kirk eyes decker then decides the best way to say
43302,0,it is plainly directly
43303,0,kirk
43304,0,im taking over the center seat
43305,0,im sorry will

43309,0,im replacing you as captain of
43310,0,the enterprise
43311,0,decker seems shocked into silence he can only peer
43312,0,at kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
43313,0,paternal hand on deckers shoulder then withdraws it
43314,0,and continues quickly
43315,0,kirk
43316,0,continuing
43317,0,youll stay aboard as executive
43318,0,officer a temporary grade
43319,0,reduction to commander

43333,0,enterprise this crew
43334,0,decker
43335,0,admiral this is an almost totally
43336,0,new enterprise you dont know
43337,0,her a tenth as well as i do
43338,0,another angle to show scott in bg across the
43339,0,room
43340,0,scott working on the relay but continually glancing
43341,0,at kirk and decker with worried concern as kirk
43342,0,replies
43343,0,kirk
43344,0,thats why youre staying aboard
43345,0,im sorry will
43346,0,decker

43349,0,when you recommended me for this
43350,0,command you told me how envious
43351,0,you were and if only you could
43352,0,find a way to get a starship
43353,0,command again well sir it looks
43354,0,like you found a way
43355,0,kirk is silent a moment peering levelly at decker
43356,0,who returns the gaze with equal intensity then
43357,0,kirk
43358,0,report to the bridge commander
43359,0,immediately
43360,0,decker exits kirk waits collecting his composure
43361,0,as he watches him go then kirk turns to glare at
43362,0,scott interrupted by a flare as something shorts

43383,0,an unusually defective looking transporter effect in
43384,0,progress alternately flashing and glowing even the

43396,0,starfleet voice
43397,0,unable to retrieve their pattern
43398,0,enterprise
43399,0,rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
43400,0,faintly materialize then fade away then reappear in
43401,0,faintly misshapen form as she frantically works con
43402,0,trols kirk enters fast steps to the console to
43403,0,assist rand scott has also come in and moves to the

43409,0,into intercom
43410,0,starfleet boost your matter gain
43411,0,we need more signal
43412,0,rand
43413,0,oh no theyre forming
43414,0,closer on the transporter chamber o
43415,0,with the human forms fluttering into fuller and fuller
43416,0,materialization frighteningly horribly misshapen we
43417,0,recognize one form as the vulcan sonak the other a
43418,0,human woman they materialize we hear a moan form
43419,0,from the vulcan the womans scream of pain then
43420,0,all at once the halfmaterialized bodies are gone
43421,0,the transporter chamber is empty
43422,0,kirk
43423,0,oh my god
43424,0,kirk scott and rand
43425,0,gazing horrified at the empty chamber
43426,0,kirk
43427,0,into intercom
43428,0,starfleet do you have them
43429,0,a mutter of utter vacant silence and kirk and
43430,0,scott look at each other again their pained faces
43431,0,presaging the answer they already know
43432,0,starfleet voice
43433,0,shaken
43434,0,enterprise what we got back
43435,0,didnt live long fortunately
43436,0,another moment of stunned silence and then kirk hits
43437,0,the transmission button fighting to control his
43438,0,voice as
43439,0,kirk
43440,0,starfleet kirk please
43441,0,express my condolences to their
43442,0,families commander sonaks

43446,0,expression
43447,0,there was nothing you could have
43448,0,done rand it wasnt your fault
43449,0,and before rand can answer kirk leaves the room
43450,0,int corridor traveling with kirk
43451,0,as kirk steps out and the doors snap closed behind
43452,0,him in the corridor the furor of the hurried depar
43453,0,ture is as everywhere quite evident crew members
43454,0,move back and forth but kirk does not see them his
43455,0,mind is tormented by the transporter accident was
43456,0,there something he should have done could have done
43457,0,to prevent it should he launch on schedule with the
43458,0,starship this unready has he done right in yielding
43459,0,to this terrible needs for starship command again
43460,0,forcing starfleet to give her to him would deckers
43461,0,knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci
43462,0,dent
43463,0,kirk reaches a corridor intersection looks around
43464,0,realizes hes lost track of where he is a passing
43465,0,yeoman stops in response to his puzzled expression
43466,0,kirk
43467,0,turboshaft eight
43468,0,yeoman
43469,0,back that way sir
43470,0,shes indicating back the direction from which kirk
43471,0,came he nods his thanks turns and moves back down
43472,0,the corridor
43473,0,decker
43474,0,hurrying down the corridor the two face each other
43475,0,a silent moment decker studying kirk curiously
43476,0,kirk
43477,0,well have to replace commander
43478,0,sonak id still like a vulcan
43479,0,there if possible
43480,0,decker
43481,0,none available captain theres
43482,0,no one in fact whos fully rated
43483,0,on this design
43484,0,kirk
43485,0,you are mister decker im
43486,0,afraid youll have to double as
43487,0,science officer
43488,0,and kirk moves on decker stands gazing reflectively
43489,0,after him
43490,0,omitted

43494,0,close full shot of the klingon ship being destroyed
43495,0,as seen on viewer o
43496,0,
43497,0,in the last part of the scene which showed the klingon
43498,0,captain speaking in klingonese and an english print
43499,0,out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom
43500,0,the klingon ship nearly totaled one engine nacelle
43501,0,gone smoke and flame spewing from the other etc
43502,0,and then that final whiplash energy bolt striking and
43503,0,spectacularly destroying the ship etc
43504,0,but this time os we hear gasps of incredulity from
43505,0,many throats an audience and various ad libbed com
43506,0,ments my god i dont believe it what
43507,0,could it be etc etc
43508,0,and then immediately following this on the viewer
43509,0,the luminescent cloud as seen on a viewer o
43510,0,as in earlier epsilon viewer but with no music
43511,0,only more ad libbed exclamations from an audience
43512,0,the viewer goes blank
43513,0,int recreation deck m
43514,0,we see that all this was being viewed by the crew
43515,0,members aliens included assembled on the rec deck
43516,0,the recreation deck is one of the largest areas on
43517,0,the ship several deck levels high a part of one
43518,0,wall consisting of picture windows through which can
43519,0,be seen sections of the drydock structure outside
43520,0,on another wall is a large viewer on which was just
43521,0,shown the klingon transmission leading off and away
43522,0,from this deck area are what are obviously other
43523,0,specific recreation areas gymnasiums food centers
43524,0,game rooms lounges etc
43525,0,another angle of the red deck higher level
43526,0,as the crew members chat in low grim tones kirk
43527,0,now with captains stripes appears as he comes
43528,0,into view the two hundred or so crew below go silent
43529,0,kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer
43530,0,kirk
43531,0,thats all we know about it

43537,0,as the camera finds various faces human alien most
43538,0,young all intelligent forthright anxious kirk
43539,0,has paused a moment now continues
43540,0,kirk os
43541,0,we assume there is a vessel of
43542,0,some type at the heart of the

43544,0,investigate and take whatever action
43545,0,is necessary and possible
43546,0,beat
43547,0,we can only hope that the

43558,0,kirk
43559,0,put it on the viewer here
43560,0,on the rec deck viewer o
43561,0,as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view
43562,0,of commander branch in the epsilon monitor room
43563,0,branch is tense reflecting extreme urgency near
43564,0,branch working intently at the console are the female

43615,0,cloud at about the same distance from which the
43616,0,klingon cruisers were attacked
43617,0,then it strikes the plantoid with full cataclysmic
43618,0,force the viewer image breaks up and immediately
43619,0,the entire starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of flar
43620,0,ing energy shattered structure flying debris and
43621,0,then all at once there is nothing empty space
43622,0,epsilon is gone we see only the stars and the

43738,0,and in you too lieutenant
43739,0,ilia

43751,0,beam up
43752,0,puzzled
43753,0,but one of them is refusing
43754,0,to step into the transporter
43755,0,just as kirk a moment before was tense now suddenly
43756,0,hes relaxed again he rises
43757,0,kirk
43758,0,pleased
43759,0,oh ill see that he beams up
43760,0,and he hurries from the bridge onto the elevator is
43761,0,gone a moment of puzzled silence then

43771,0,to ilia
43772,0,your preprogramming is already
43773,0,set in lieutenant
43774,0,sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair he
43775,0,starts offering ilia his hand then thinks better of
43776,0,it withdraws it abruptly immediately busies himself
43777,0,punching out equations on her console ad libs
43778,0,its all on the computer youll have no problem
43779,0,sulu is nervous fluttery around this lovely creature
43780,0,now hits a wrong switch produces a beeping sound which
43781,0,he fumbles to shut off she smiles speaks quietly
43782,0,repeats
43783,0,ilia
43784,0,im sworn to celibacy mister
43785,0,sulu that makes me as safe
43786,0,as any human female
43787,0,sulu catches her eye but before he can reply decker has
43788,0,moved in beside ilia

44338,0,phasers were automatically cut
44339,0,off
44340,0,kirk is surprised by this information perhaps slight
44341,0,ly chagrined after a beat

44422,0,kirk
44423,0,make your point doctor
44424,0,mccoy
44425,0,the point captain is that its
44426,0,you whos competing
44427,0,a beat as kirk reacts
44428,0,you pulled every string in the
44429,0,book short of blackmail to get
44430,0,the enterprise maybe even
44431,0,that and when this mission is
44432,0,over you have no intention of
44433,0,giving her back
44434,0,kirk
44435,0,tight
44436,0,i intend to keep her is that
44437,0,what youre saying doctor
44438,0,mccoy
44439,0,its an obsession that can
44440,0,blind you so far more immediate
44441,0,and critical responsibilities
44442,0,your reaction to decker is an
44443,0,example
44444,0,kirk studies him a beat has mccoy touched a nerve
44445,0,something kirk himself might have been unaware of

44674,0,he complies but sits formally rigidly he ignores
44675,0,mccoy totally
44676,0,kirk
44677,0,youve reported that you felt
44678,0,strong thought emotions a
44679,0,group of minds from a space
44680,0,vessel could you make out any
44681,0,plan anything to do with
44682,0,earth
44683,0,spock
44684,0,still formally
44685,0,negative captain i could sense
44686,0,only what seemed an almost
44687,0,omniscient pattern of perfect
44688,0,logic i can explain nothing
44689,0,more i understand nothing more
44690,0,kirk is clearly disappointed and a bit uncomfortable
44691,0,about what he must ask next he exchanges a glance
44692,0,with mccoy then
44693,0,kirk
44694,0,also there was nothing in your
44695,0,report about why youre here
44696,0,spock
44697,0,that inquiry invades my personal
44698,0,life captain
44699,0,mccoy
44700,0,spock weve already guessed why
44701,0,youre here
44702,0,kirk
44703,0,i inquired about you learned
44704,0,you were studying with the
44705,0,masters
44706,0,although spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless
44707,0,his expression shifts slightly mccoy indicates this
44708,0,mccoy
44709,0,that flicker of emotion confirms
44710,0,our guess you failed

44734,0,if you achieve perfect logic spock
44735,0,youll pay a price its given

46232,0,this device serves no purpose
46233,0,she steps away from the game deckers disappointment
46234,0,is evident so is everyone elses
46235,0,kirk
46236,0,damn
46237,0,mccoy
46238,0,nods grimly
46239,0,she needs something else
46240,0,something much more personal to
46241,0,stimulate memory patterns something
46242,0,with a more emotional tie
46243,0,kirk reacts to this reflective
46244,0,int rec deck full on decker and ilia
46245,0,decker waving back toward the general area of the
46246,0,enterprise pictures
46247,0,decker
46248,0,the crews of the previous
46249,0,enterprises were also carbon units
46250,0,in what way is the life form in
46251,0,your vessel different
46252,0,ilia
46253,0,carbon units are not true life
46254,0,forms do those images repre
46255,0,sent how enterprise has evolved
46256,0,into its present form
46257,0,decker
46258,0,hoping hes struck
46259,0,a responsive chord
46260,0,yes
46261,0,ilia
46262,0,carbon units have clearly retarded
46263,0,enterprises proper evolvement
46264,0,decker
46265,0,controlling surprise
46266,0,what is enterprises proper
46267,0,evolvement
46268,0,ilia
46269,0,enterprise should not require
46270,0,the presence of carbon units
46271,0,and with this she moves off observing other rec deck
46272,0,objects decker moves with her then
46273,0,decker
46274,0,carefully
46275,0,enterprise would be unable to
46276,0,function without carbon units
46277,0,ilia
46278,0,more data concerning this functioning
46279,0,is necessary before carbon units can
46280,0,be patterned for data storage
46281,0,across ilia to decker
46282,0,as he reacts to this ominous note he stops abruptly
46283,0,decker
46284,0,what does that mean
46285,0,ilia
46286,0,stopping almost
46287,0,pleasantly
46288,0,when my examination is complete
46289,0,the carbon units will be reduced
46290,0,to data patterns
46291,0,this has been delivered with chilling blandness and
46292,0,she stands facing decker almost as though waiting for
46293,0,him to thank her he thinks fast now
46294,0,decker
46295,0,within you are memory patterns of
46296,0,a carbon unit if i can help you
46297,0,revive these patterns you could
46298,0,understand our functions better
46299,0,ilia
46300,0,that is logical you may procede
46301,0,on decker

46305,0,the ship stationary in the chamber as now we see an
46306,0,exterior hatch sliding fully open up through the
46307,0,hatch a circular airlock door opens and a tiny
46308,0,figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges steps into
46309,0,space slowly floats down through the hatch and under
46310,0,the enterprise saucer section in this and subsequent
46311,0,views we will see that on the rear pack of his thruster
46312,0,spacesuit is a flashing strobe light which regularly
46313,0,emits the identifying signal of this particular suit
46314,0,by which kirk will be able to see spocks position
46315,0,even from several miles away

46350,0,his features now set into an almost trancelike expres
46351,0,sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations
46352,0,then we see his head turn he peers off then he
46353,0,moves his thruster controls we see the small blue
46354,0,jets of his thrusters his spacesuit figure begins
46355,0,to move off in the direction he was concentrating
46356,0,upon
46357,0,another angle spock
46358,0,his thrusters moving him across vgers vast chamber
46359,0,then dropping down into a deep troughlike area
46360,0,which stretches into the distance ahead of him a
46361,0,cloud of crystal forms kirks entrapment become
46362,0,visible to one side but spock passes them at some dis
46363,0,tance and does not attract them
46364,0,we can see more clearly now the point on the inner wall
46365,0,of the trough toward which spock is heading it is an
46366,0,unusual combination of glowing forcefields which seem
46367,0,to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance
46368,0,here also we will become aware of sensorbee
46369,0,swarms intermittently darting toward this same wall
46370,0,from all points of the chamber
46371,0,int airlock area
46372,0,showing kirk in a thruster spacesuit helmet being
46373,0,readied by airlock technicians mccoy is also here

46376,0,from the start

46381,0,and if that whatever has taken
46382,0,over his mind
46383,0,kirk
46384,0,then hell have still led me to

46386,0,and kirk steps into the airlock door hits a control

46388,0,int vger angle up toward enterprise
46389,0,up through the circular airlock door as it slides open

46411,0,int ilias quarters
46412,0,the door snapping open and ilia mccoy and decker
46413,0,entering then camera reveals chapel already inside
46414,0,looking through some female adornments shes found
46415,0,there
46416,0,chapel
46417,0,i remember lt ilia once mentioning
46418,0,that she wore this
46419,0,decker
46420,0,reacting tight
46421,0,when we met
46422,0,clearly this is very painful to decker meanwhile
46423,0,chapel hands the deltan headband to ilia
46424,0,
46425,0,chapel
46426,0,gently
46427,0,put it on
46428,0,ilia hasnt the slightest idea what to do with the
46429,0,headband holds it runs her fingers over the jewels
46430,0,and feathers embedded into it chapel takes it from
46431,0,her places it on ilias head now switches on the
46432,0,light illuminating the dressing table mirror stands
46433,0,behind her with decker both watching apprehensively
46434,0,angle on ilia
46435,0,studying her image in the mirror her face totally
46436,0,blank a moment but then breaking into a bemused
46437,0,frown as though trying to remember and
46438,0,chapel
46439,0,helpfully
46440,0,ilia
46441,0,decker
46442,0,quiet urging
46443,0,on delta remember
46444,0,and it seems that ilia does remember she peers at
46445,0,her image then sets the headband into its exact
46446,0,proper position then she turns and looks at them
46447,0,with recognition
46448,0,ilia
46449,0,haltingly
46450,0,dr chapel
46451,0,across chapel to decker
46452,0,as chapel smiles pleased and looks at decker who
46453,0,stares at ilia nonplussed this is ilia coming
46454,0,alive
46455,0,ilia
46456,0,to decker
46457,0,will
46458,0,and she touches his hand runs her own hand over it
46459,0,and smiles
46460,0,decker is completely overwhelmed struggles for words
46461,0,and looks to mccoy for some kind of help mccoy
46462,0,realizes decker is losing himself in fantasy
46463,0,mccoy
46464,0,gently reminding
46465,0,commander this is a mechanism
46466,0,decker is startled and for another slitsecond hes
46467,0,lost but then he realizes the reality and what he
46468,0,should do
46469,0,decker
46470,0,gently but urgingly
46471,0,ilia help us make direct contact
46472,0,with vger
46473,0,ilia
46474,0,i cannot
46475,0,decker looks at ilias hand still resting on his
46476,0,then
46477,0,decker
46478,0,then tell us who vger is where
46479,0,hes from w need your help
46480,0,for another moment ilia continues smiling at decker
46481,0,holding his hand then abruptly the smile vanishes
46482,0,the hand is released clearly shes again the
46483,0,probe as
46484,0,ilia
46485,0,why have two carbon units entered
46486,0,vger
46487,0,decker glances at mccoy who shakes his head almost
46488,0,imperceptibly he doesnt know but decker has an
46489,0,obvious reply
46490,0,decker
46491,0,they want to make contact with
46492,0,vger
46493,0,trying to revive
46494,0,ilias memory again
46495,0,touches her hand
46496,0,ilia
46497,0,ilia peers at him blankly allows him to continue
46498,0,touching her hand but obviously it means nothing to
46499,0,her
46500,0,decker
46501,0,continuing
46502,0,distressed
46503,0,to ilia
46504,0,does vger object to the presence
46505,0,of the two carbon units
46506,0,ilia
46507,0,the carbon units are of no
46508,0,consequence vger will determine
46509,0,their purpose
46510,0,mccoy
46511,0,their purpose is to survive
46512,0,ilia
46513,0,that is also vgers purpose
46514,0,deckers face reflects his bemusement
46515,0,decker
46516,0,you said vgers purpose was to
46517,0,find and join with the creator
46518,0,ilia
46519,0,that is how vger will survive
46520,0,on decker
46521,0,as now the bemusement changes to just the slightest
46522,0,enlightenment
46523,0,ilia
46524,0,i wish to continue my observations

46528,0,spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench
46529,0,as he continues forward progress in the direction he
46530,0,saw spock taking
46531,0,closer on kirk
46532,0,so we can see his face through the plate as he looks

46540,0,his attention fixed on spock he never notices until
46541,0,an instant too late an os object quickly he hits a

46545,0,a swarm of strangelooking translucent crystallike
46546,0,forms on a collision course with kirk note they

46549,0,them and the swarm of them heads in his direction

46654,0,points off into the distance
46655,0,another angle including inner wall o
46656,0,we can see what appear to be sparkling globules of
46657,0,light darting toward the inner wall in the distance
46658,0,then disappearing there well see other swarms

46678,0,part of theses patterns
46679,0,closer on kirk and spock
46680,0,as they approach and then we see the brief reverse
46681,0,thrusters and then forward momentum stops motionless
46682,0,then spock sees something indicates
46683,0,long angle to include sensor swarm o
46684,0,now we see that they are tiny multicolored points
46685,0,of flashing light almost like swarms of bees
46686,0,they approach the inner wall at this central point
46687,0,and seem to disappear through the orifice
46688,0,kirk and spock another swarm approaching o
46689,0,this sensor swarm has been coming from a direction
46690,0,that will take them close past kirk and spock then
46691,0,as it passes spock reaches out quickly grabs
46692,0,he turns to kirk his hand closed on something
46693,0,close on kirk and spock against tube wall
46694,0,spock opens his hand retaining a hold on something
46695,0,with his fingers he brings it up to kirks face mask
46696,0,its a tiny sensor its multicolors flashing as it
46697,0,tries to escape from spocks fingers and in this close
46698,0,view we see that this is a sensor very much like the
46699,0,one weve seen earlier embedded in the iliaprobes
46700,0,throat hollow then spock releases it and it darts
46701,0,to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
46702,0,wall
46703,0,kirk and spocks pov o
46704,0,from this closer distance we see that an opening ap
46705,0,pears in the wall admits the sensor swarm then closes

46718,0,but as they stop their forward momentum their eyes
46719,0,widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing
46720,0,a what they see m a
46721,0,the long cave chamber with its row of huge mediator
46722,0,balls extending into the distance to one side the
46723,0,gleaming crystal memory wall
46724,0,b kirk and spock b
46725,0,as spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what
46726,0,they are seeing then he takes out his tricorder
46727,0,again propels himself toward the memory crystals
46728,0,kirk follows
46729,0,c at memory crystal c
46730,0,as spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings
46731,0,spock
46732,0,it would appear that the atomic
46733,0,arrays of these crystals store
46734,0,information a remarkably
46735,0,efficient system
46736,0,kirk
46737,0,indicates
46738,0,and these sensorswarms collect
46739,0,that data carry it here
46740,0,spock
46741,0,nods indicates
46742,0,new crystals they must contain
46743,0,the most recent data obtained
46744,0,and spock touches one of these new crystals it will be
46745,0,shinier more pulsating than the others another rapid
46746,0,profusion of faint images but this time including a
46747,0,patternlike image of klingons klingon vessels the
46748,0,ones destroyed by the cloud and obvious starfleet
46749,0,personnel and the epsilon station also a pattern
46750,0,of the security guard killed by the probe and ilia
46751,0,
46752,0,kirk
46753,0,klingons our epsilon station
46754,0,and ilia they seem to be
46755,0,more than just images
46756,0,spock
46757,0,agreeing
46758,0,exact patterns the energy bolt
46759,0,that hit them wasnt simply a
46760,0,weapon it dematerialized them
46761,0,stored them but why
46762,0,and he turns and begins moving on studying the wall
46763,0,consulting his tricorder
46764,0,across them to another section of the wall
46765,0,spock inspecting this area at which the newer crystals
46766,0,are pulsating and glowing and which appears to be a
46767,0,termination of the crystal area continuing on and dis
46768,0,appearing through the wall
46769,0,kirk
46770,0,if this is their ships data
46771,0,banks where is the crew or
46772,0,is their entire ship automated
46773,0,spock
46774,0,captain i do not believe there
46775,0,is a crew or that this is a
46776,0,vessel as such
46777,0,a beat as kirk reacts incredulously
46778,0,spock
46779,0,continuing
46780,0,i am almost certain now that all
46781,0,of this is vger i believe
46782,0,that we are inside a life form
46783,0,a living machine
46784,0,spock turns his spacesuit turns his tricorder out to
46785,0,ward the mediator balls takes a reading in that di
46786,0,rection then a glance to kirk
46787,0,spock
46788,0,i must attempt mindmeld with it
46789,0,captain
46790,0,spock touches his spacesuit controls the thruster
46791,0,jets move him out toward the mediator balls
46792,0,kirk
46793,0,warningly
46794,0,spock
46795,0,angle at mediator ball
46796,0,spock reaching the ball halts his momentum and removes
46797,0,one gauntlet baring his hand stretching the bare
46798,0,hand toward a part of it which looks strangely alive
46799,0,the very power generated from this area is clearly
46800,0,affecting spocks hand meanwhile kirk has used his
46801,0,thrusters to join him
46802,0,kirk
46803,0,spock if youre right its mind
46804,0,may be enormous
46805,0,but spock pays him no attention his entire being now
46806,0,focused on the pulsating glow of the alive area
46807,0,the camera moving in closer to spock as he forces his
46808,0,hand toward that surface closer closer
46809,0,kirk
46810,0,watching almost mesmerized torn between wanting to
46811,0,pull spock away from the wall and knowing that
46812,0,spock must go through with it for everyones sake
46813,0,closer on spock
46814,0,preparing for the ordeal moving his hand to the liv
46815,0,ing area the invisible force even stronger but
46816,0,spocks strength unwavering and now he touches the
46817,0,surface and it flares with strange energy at the
46818,0,touch and at the same moment spock body convulses
46819,0,as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
46820,0,charging through him
46821,0,close on spocks face
46822,0,as he begins to shudder with the shock the camera
46823,0,continues into extreme closeup as we see spocks mouth
46824,0,open he screams camera into extreme close shot of
46825,0,spocks eyes
46826,0,camera zoom through spocks eyes
46827,0,music in and up as we travel through abstract images
46828,0,per con pederson discussion symbolizing vgers
46829,0,incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge
46830,0,these images suggest patterns of atoms molecules
46831,0,galaxies dimensions of the universe beyond human
46832,0,knowledge or comprehension it takes only fifteen or
46833,0,twenty seconds but seems to span aeons taking us
46834,0,through microinfinity and macroinfinity
46835,0,dissolve to
46836,0,int dispensary spocks eyes
46837,0,camera bridging back out through spocks eyes and into
46838,0,angle on spocks face as he lies in a sickbay bed his
46839,0,eyes are open he is staring straight ahead as if in a
46840,0,catatonic state completly unaware of his surroundings
46841,0,then doctor chapel leans into scene moving a medical
46842,0,scanner over the brain area
46843,0,chapel
46844,0,now scanning pons area at spinal
46845,0,nerve fiber connection
46846,0,angle on mccoy and kirk
46847,0,mccoy at a console watching readings he is getting
46848,0,from chapels scanner kirk watches mccoy anxiously
46849,0,mccoy
46850,0,indications of some neurological
46851,0,traumathe power pouring through
46852,0,that mindmeld must have been
46853,0,staggering
46854,0,before kirk can reply they hear a laugh an abrupt
46855,0,harsh bitter laugh
46856,0,across them to sickbay
46857,0,as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
46858,0,spock who has just laughed but there is no indication
46859,0,of laughter from him now a startled chapel has stepped
46860,0,back away from the bed spock seems to be attempting
46861,0,to focus orient himself as kirk and mccoy hurry to the
46862,0,bedside
46863,0,spock
46864,0,quiet
46865,0,jim
46866,0,and spock reaches out a hand weakly takes a surprised
46867,0,kirks hand in his mccoy exchanges a surprised glance
46868,0,with kirk as spock clutching kirks hand in friend
46869,0,ship and need struggles to summon strength to speak
46870,0,spock
46871,0,continuing
46872,0,this simple feeling
46873,0,looks at kirk
46874,0,is so far beyond vgers
46875,0,comprehension
46876,0,another angle
46877,0,with kirk and mccoy exchanging another surprised
46878,0,glance at spocks emotion with mccoy gesturing kirk
46879,0,not to question it
46880,0,kirk
46881,0,gently
46882,0,were you right spock vger
46883,0,is a living machine
46884,0,
46885,0,spock
46886,0,nodding
46887,0,a life form of its own a
46888,0,conscious living entity
46889,0,chapel
46890,0,reacting
46891,0,a living machine
46892,0,mccoy
46893,0,to chapel
46894,0,were living machines too protein
46895,0,mechanisms
46896,0,kirk nods at mccoy
46897,0,kirk
46898,0,and it considers the enterprise a
46899,0,living machine thats why the
46900,0,probe refers to our ship as an
46901,0,entity
46902,0,chapel
46903,0,if it thinks our ship is alive
46904,0,what does it think we are
46905,0,mccoy
46906,0,dryly
46907,0,an infestation bacteria
46908,0,microbes
46909,0,another angle
46910,0,as spock turns to kirk
46911,0,spock
46912,0,i saw vgers planet a planet
46913,0,populated by living machines
46914,0,unbelievable technology
46915,0,pained
46916,0,vger has knowledge that spans this
46917,0,universe
46918,0,and in all this order all
46919,0,this magnificence vger feels
46920,0,no aweno delight no beauty
46921,0,a beat exhausted
46922,0,i should have known
46923,0,kirk waits for spock to continue but spock seems too
46924,0,weak
46925,0,kirk
46926,0,know what spock what
46927,0,but spock falls back exhausted and mccoy gently
46928,0,tugs at kirk adlibbing let him rest jim
46929,0,kirk shrugs mccoy away addresses spock
46930,0,kirk
46931,0,continuing
46932,0,what should you have known
46933,0,spock
46934,0,weak
46935,0,no meaning no hope
46936,0,summoning strength
46937,0,and jim no answers
46938,0,jim its looking for answers
46939,0,itself
46940,0,kirk
46941,0,what answers
46942,0,spock
46943,0,is this all i am is there not
46944,0,more
46945,0,just then an intercom signal
46946,0,uhuras voice
46947,0,a faint signal from starfleet
46948,0,sir intruder cloud has been
46949,0,located on their outer monitors
46950,0,for past twentyseven minutes
46951,0,dissipating rapidly as it approaches
46952,0,immediately sulus voice
46953,0,sulus voice
46954,0,starfleet reports forward velocity
46955,0,has slowed to subwarp speed we
46956,0,are three minutes from earths
46957,0,orbit
46958,0,kirk
46959,0,into intercom
46960,0,ill be right there
46961,0,to chapel crisp
46962,0,i need spock on the bridge
46963,0,another angle
46964,0,as chapel urns to a med tech ad libs an order
46965,0,dalaphaline twenty ccs as the tech quickly sets
46966,0,the hypoinjector and hands it to chapel and she
46967,0,injects spock the hypo emitting a fast quiet hiss
46968,0,kirk gazes at spock just an instant as spock breathes
46969,0,deeply the drug clearly strengthening him chapel
46970,0,and the tech help spock from the bed as kirk addresses
46971,0,mccoy
46972,0,kirk
46973,0,a machine planet sending a
46974,0,machine to earth looking for its
46975,0,creator
46976,0,mccoy
46977,0,god
46978,0,kirk looks at him then at spock on his feet now
46979,0,then at mccoy again
46980,0,kirk
46981,0,to find the creator the probe
46982,0,said find god
46983,0,mccoy
46984,0,isnt that what were all trying
46985,0,to do
46986,0,dryly
46987,0,all us machines
46988,0,kirk stands facing him another moment then whirls
46989,0,and steps to the monitor flips some buttons and
46990,0,peaks into his communicator
46991,0,kirk
46992,0,mr chekov commander deckers
46993,0,present location
46994,0,chekovs voice
46995,0,he they are in engineering
46996,0,sir
46997,0,kirk
46998,0,into intercom
46999,0,i want to make a ships announcement
47000,0,but its to be heard only in
47001,0,engineering
47002,0,uhuras voice
47003,0,ready captain
47004,0,kirk
47005,0,voice amplified
47006,0,this is the captain speaking it
47007,0,appears that the alien ship
47008,0,vger is not a manned vessel
47009,0,engineering
47010,0,showing scott at his console listening to kirks
47011,0,words and facing decker and ilia who are just
47012,0,about to leave engineering in bg the engine core
47013,0,glows the appropriate color and there is a soft
47014,0,hum of idle power kirks voice continues
47015,0,kirks voice
47016,0,amplified
47017,0,it is a living entity a machine
47018,0,life form we are attempting to
47019,0,ascertain its intentions all
47020,0,personnel will maintain yellow alert
47021,0,status
47022,0,closer on decker and ilia
47023,0,
47024,0,the probe bland as usual but kirks words seem to
47025,0,have strangely elated decker he says to her
47026,0,decker
47027,0,a machine then it had to be
47028,0,programmed by whom
47029,0,ilia
47030,0,by the creator
47031,0,decker
47032,0,probing
47033,0,to join and become one with the
47034,0,creator
47035,0,ilia
47036,0,to learn all that is learnable
47037,0,to deliver all collected data to
47038,0,the creator on the third planet
47039,0,that is the programming
47040,0,include scott
47041,0,just now confronting them regarding ilia with open
47042,0,disapproval
47043,0,scott
47044,0,well sir now what about all that
47045,0,a living entity the captain says
47046,0,entity a living thing
47047,0,decker really hasnt heard scott hes gazing at ilia
47048,0,attempting to digest what shes just said but quickly
47049,0,decker
47050,0,thank you scotty
47051,0,he moves to leave
47052,0,scott
47053,0,dourly
47054,0,your welcome sir
47055,0,now decker and ilia move toward the exit scott gaz
47056,0,ing after them glaringly watching ilias every
47057,0,move suddenly almost into the corridor ilia turns
47058,0,and looks back at the engine room she addresses
47059,0,decker but load enough for scott to overhear
47060,0,ilia
47061,0,there is no logical reason for
47062,0,carbon units to control enterprises
47063,0,power systems
47064,0,scott
47065,0,to ilia
47066,0,lassie if i were functioning
47067,0,logically right now id be
47068,0,showing you the inside of our
47069,0,scrap metal compactor
47070,0,int bridge
47071,0,kirk with mccoy and spock who although somewhat shaky
47072,0,is clearly more alert they are just assuming their
47073,0,stations
47074,0,uhura
47075,0,were now locked into starfleets
47076,0,transceivers admiral nogura has
47077,0,received your reports sir
47078,0,angle including viewer o
47079,0,kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer
47080,0,on which is appearing an image of vger looming omi
47081,0,nously in orbit over earth
47082,0,uhura
47083,0,the visual is a lunar monitor
47084,0,relay sir
47085,0,as they begin to study it the image suddenly distorts and
47086,0,is replaced by signal interference signal static lines
47087,0,running across the viewer screen
47088,0,somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
47089,0,sometimes seen on the television screen
47090,0,uhura
47091,0,continuing
47092,0,heavy interference sir its
47093,0,coming from here inside the

47095,0,uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we
47096,0,hear a series of carrier wave beeps spock looks up from
47097,0,his console listens to it
47098,0,spock
47099,0,puzzling the interference
47100,0,appears to be a rather simple

47113,0,decker
47114,0,nods turns to kirk
47115,0,vger is announcing that it has
47116,0,arrived sir that its ready
47117,0,to deliver the information it
47118,0,was programmed to collect
47119,0,ilia
47120,0,to learn all that is learnable
47121,0,decker
47122,0,to kirk
47123,0,it expects a return signal now
47124,0,ordering it to transmit that

47126,0,uhura
47127,0,whirling
47128,0,sir vgers signals have
47129,0,stopped
47130,0,ilia
47131,0,as if frightened
47132,0,decker the creator has not
47133,0,responded
47134,0,kirk hears this turning inquiringly toward her but
47135,0,uhura interrupts
47136,0,uhura
47137,0,picking up starfleet again a

47139,0,angle including viewer o
47140,0,as indeed the interference is fading and a new main
47141,0,viewer image is appearing it shows vger in earth
47142,0,orbit with a strange looking object moving away from
47143,0,vger it is an ominous looking huge swirling green
47144,0,mass it resembles the same green plasmaenergy bolts
47145,0,that destroyed the klingons and epsilon and very
47146,0,nearly the enterprise it is not a bolt now the mass
47147,0,is much larger and appears much more deadly a second
47148,0,object has now formed and moves off a third one begins
47149,0,to appear meanwhile the first and second plasma
47150,0,energy objects are moving off into the distance in
47151,0,different direction
47152,0,mccoy

47180,0,uhura
47181,0,continuing
47182,0,sir starfleet computes their

47209,0,the carbonunits are not
47210,0,responsible for that
47211,0,ilia
47212,0,you infest and control enterprise

47214,0,with the creator in the same manner
47215,0,spock
47216,0,to kirk

47224,0,
47225,0,three of the four ominous swirling green objects have
47226,0,all moved away from vger now in different directions
47227,0,growing smaller in the distance the fourth object is
47228,0,holding position nearby seeming to grow in size and
47229,0,intensity
47230,0,angle emphasizing kirk
47231,0,as he throws a look toward spock who is now in deep
47232,0,meditation kirk turns and takes ilias shoulders
47233,0,and carefully turns her to face him
47234,0,mccoy
47235,0,similar life forms
47236,0,jim vgers saying the creator
47237,0,is a machine
47238,0,decker
47239,0,grimly amused
47240,0,of course we all create god
47241,0,in our own image
47242,0,kirk peers at decker a moment ingesting this thought
47243,0,then he addresses ilia again this time with emotion
47244,0,after all he is pleading for the survival of the
47245,0,entire planet
47246,0,kirk
47247,0,vger if we are lesser beings
47248,0,we are still like you living
47249,0,and because we are alive we
47250,0,like you wish to survive
47251,0,you must not destroy
47252,0,
47253,0,kirk pauses abruptly ilia is regarding him blandly
47254,0,stonily not the slightest reaction or response
47255,0,clearly kirks plea is being ignored
47256,0,kirk draws in his breath to continue realizes the
47257,0,futility turns helplessly to spock
47258,0,across kirk to spock
47259,0,who has been listening intently with near fascination
47260,0,an idea forming in his mind quickly he steps
47261,0,down to kirk
47262,0,spock
47263,0,quiet terse
47264,0,captain
47265,0,reaches kirk

47283,0,how do we teach it that thats
47284,0,wrong with a spanking
47285,0,spock peers at mccoy almost sadly then replies to
47286,0,decker
47287,0,spock
47288,0,it doesnt know what it needs
47289,0,comm ander
47290,0,to kirk
47291,0,it does not know
47292,0,kirk says nothing looks at spock who is awaiting a
47293,0,reaction then kirk glances at ilia his brain
47294,0,is racing struggling to reach a decision and then
47295,0,kirk

47381,0,the information vger requires
47382,0,will also be destroyed

47384,0,a including viewer a
47385,0,as light show outside perceptically recedes and simul
47386,0,taneously the rocking ceases at the same time ilia
47387,0,is saying
47388,0,ilia
47389,0,it is illogical to withhold
47390,0,required information
47391,0,kirk does not reply to this turns away to observe
47392,0,the withdrawing crew most are out only spock
47393,0,decker and mccoy remain behind with mccoy on his
47394,0,way the bridge lighting dims and now kirk looks at
47395,0,spock who nods approvingly clearly spock is the only
47396,0,person who seems to comprehend what kirk is doing and
47397,0,why as kirk now moves toward the exit and the lights
47398,0,are dimmed even further
47399,0,ilia
47400,0,almost polite
47401,0,kirkunit why do you not
47402,0,disclose information
47403,0,kirk
47404,0,because vger is going to
47405,0,destroy all the carbon units
47406,0,on the third planet
47407,0,ilia
47408,0,they have repressed the creator
47409,0,kirk
47410,0,the information will not be
47411,0,disclosed
47412,0,and gesturing the others ahead of him kirk starts
47413,0,toward the bridge elevator ilia calls after him
47414,0,ilia
47415,0,almost a plea
47416,0,vger needs the information
47417,0,at the elevators
47418,0,
47419,0,decker and mccoy about to enter spock and kirk just
47420,0,behind all stopping abruptly now at ilias state
47421,0,ment the very tone of her voice is enough for them
47422,0,to realize they have made a very telling point kirk
47423,0,follows fast
47424,0,kirk
47425,0,then vger must withdraw its
47426,0,orbiting devices
47427,0,ilia
47428,0,vger will comply if the carbon
47429,0,units disclose the information
47430,0,angle on mccoy
47431,0,wryly reacting to this
47432,0,mccoy
47433,0,it learns fast doesnt it
47434,0,across mccoy to kirk and spock
47435,0,as kirk looks at spock kirks whole expression convey
47436,0,ing the obvious question what the hell do we do now
47437,0,but spock is ready with an answer
47438,0,spock
47439,0,captain the vessel vger
47440,0,obviously operates from a
47441,0,central brain complex
47442,0,spock allows the sentence to hang as he and kirk
47443,0,eye each other significantly the camera swinging
47444,0,over to kirk so we can perceive that to kirk this
47445,0,idea has an even greater significance
47446,0,kirk
47447,0,to spock
47448,0,the orbiting devices would be
47449,0,controlled from the point
47450,0,then
47451,0,spock
47452,0,precisely
47453,0,kirk nods grimly faces ilia again this time
47454,0,hes playing for all the stakes
47455,0,kirk
47456,0,the carbon units information
47457,0,cannot be disclosed to vgers
47458,0,probe only to vger directly
47459,0,another angle reactions
47460,0,all wait with hushed expectancy all eyes on ilia
47461,0,who seems momentarily in some internal communication
47462,0,she turns away from kirk and steps forward looking at
47463,0,the main viewer
47464,0,mccoy
47465,0,indicating
47466,0,viewer
47467,0,jim
47468,0,past them to viewer
47469,0,the image of the chamber in which the enterprise is
47470,0,imprisoned but now toward the chamberend where
47471,0,further passage had previously been barred by the lace
47472,0,work energy barriers an opening appears and at
47473,0,the same time there is a gentle lurching effect and
47474,0,decker
47475,0,forward motion captain
47476,0,spock
47477,0,a tractor beam
47478,0,ilia steps down from the platform and into the well
47479,0,where she is closer to the viewer
47480,0,decker
47481,0,captain whats the next move
47482,0,kirk
47483,0,the question is mr decker is
47484,0,there a next move
47485,0,int vger the enterprise
47486,0,moving through the chamber pulled by the invisible
47487,0,tractor beam toward the opening toward the next
47488,0,chamber which from this pov seems even larger
47489,0,more forbidding
47490,0,int bridge
47491,0,as the four officers step down onto the bridge spock
47492,0,hurrying to his science station kirk to the center
47493,0,seat
47494,0,kirk
47495,0,resume duty stations mr decker
47496,0,as kirk attends to his console deck is at an
47497,0,intercom
47498,0,decker
47499,0,into intercom
47500,0,voice amplified
47501,0,all personnel resume stations
47502,0,at the same time the lights are brightening and
47503,0,members of the bridge crew begin returning all this
47504,0,time there is an ever increasing sense of movement
47505,0,kirk glances at decker
47506,0,kirk
47507,0,well mr decker it seems my
47508,0,bluff is being called
47509,0,decker
47510,0,im afraid our hand is pretty
47511,0,weak captain
47512,0,slight smile
47513,0,but its the only game in town
47514,0,
47515,0,kirk reacts pleased a split beat at deckers our
47516,0,hand and goes on
47517,0,kirk throws him a look of appreciation then abruptly
47518,0,his manner changes as he addresses chekov
47519,0,kirk
47520,0,mr chekov when do those devices
47521,0,activate
47522,0,chekov
47523,0,they reach final position in
47524,0,twentyseven minutes mark

47529,0,int engineering scott
47530,0,at his console a female engineering technician chief
47531,0,ross nearby the usual engine room ambience in the

47533,0,scott
47534,0,scott here sir
47535,0,int bridge kirk with an angle on spock
47536,0,as kirk hesitates glances around at the crew now
47537,0,all having resumed their stations and then grimly
47538,0,looks at ilia who still remains at the rail
47539,0,kirk
47540,0,into intercom
47541,0,eyes on ilia
47542,0,mr scott be prepared to execute
47543,0,starfleet order two zero zero
47544,0,five
47545,0,hearing this spock whirls around peers incredulously
47546,0,at kirk he appears for a moment to be incensed at
47547,0,kirks words then he realizes and understands kirks
47548,0,position and turns sadly resigned back to his work
47549,0,int engineering
47550,0,as scott too hears this but his reaction is of grim
47551,0,acceptance not so chief ross she is horrified
47552,0,scott
47553,0,with a glance at
47554,0,ross into intercom
47555,0,when captain
47556,0,kirks intercom voice

47558,0,scott
47559,0,somberly into
47560,0,intercom
47561,0,aye sir
47562,0,and scott hits buttons on his console now moves to
47563,0,step from his station nearly collides with ross who
47564,0,clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise
47565,0,and dignity
47566,0,ross
47567,0,why has the captain ordered self
47568,0,destruct sir
47569,0,scott
47570,0,a beat gently
47571,0,i would say lass because he
47572,0,thinks he hopes that when
47573,0,we go up well take vger
47574,0,with us
47575,0,ross
47576,0,will we
47577,0,scott
47578,0,with grim
47579,0,satisfaction
47580,0,when that much matter and anti
47581,0,matter are brought together
47582,0,oh yes we will indeed
47583,0,ext enterprise int vger
47584,0,the ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
47585,0,more active than anything we have previously seen
47586,0,directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
47587,0,powerfields a tremendous volume of them seem to ema
47588,0,nate and converge there the medium from which the
47589,0,ship moves appears almost solid to the point where it
47590,0,seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
47591,0,it at all the entire chamber pulses with machine
47592,0,like alien life this should even be evidenced in the
47593,0,booming powerfield lightening bolts as they course in
47594,0,ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as
47595,0,a int bridge including the viewer a
47596,0,the crew all watching the awesome spectacle of vgers
47597,0,interior on the viewer as the enterprise is being
47598,0,pulled toward the brain complex all are somewhat sub
47599,0,dued for all realize how their journey will end but
47600,0,at the same time they also realize there is no other
47601,0,way the camera pans catching facial reactions as

47622,0,kirks back to spock as he watches the viewer kirk
47623,0,now turning toward spock
47624,0,kirk
47625,0,spock spock
47626,0,spock does not respond then kirk reacts with momentary
47627,0,annoyance then realizes spock is totally distracted
47628,0,kirk peers at him a moment then suddenly rises and
47629,0,steps up to
47630,0,spocks station kirk and spock mccoy in bg
47631,0,as kirk arrives with spock still facing away from
47632,0,him clearly distracted
47633,0,kirk
47634,0,starts
47635,0,mr spock i think
47636,0,spock moves to face him turning fully into the camera
47637,0,so we can see now just under spocks eye
47638,0,a tear welling fom the eye rolling down his cheek
47639,0,kirk is speechless a moment glances at mccoy who has
47640,0,also witnessed this phenomenon and started toward
47641,0,spock but kirk gestures mccoy to stay back as he
47642,0,addresses spock
47643,0,kirk
47644,0,quiet feeling
47645,0,not for us
47646,0,spock
47647,0,no captain not for us for vger
47648,0,
47649,0,spock pauses as kirk peers incredulously at him then
47650,0,continues
47651,0,spock
47652,0,continuing
47653,0,i weep for vger as i would for
47654,0,a brother far more knowledgeable
47655,0,than i and yet one step behind
47656,0,angle on mccoy and decker
47657,0,listening mccoys face reflecting concern deckers
47658,0,face compassion and understanding with decker step
47659,0,ping closer to spock as spock continues
47660,0,spock
47661,0,as i was when i came aboard
47662,0,so is vger now empty incomplete
47663,0,searching logic and knowledge are
47664,0,not enough
47665,0,mccoy
47666,0,with empathy
47667,0,spock are you saying that you
47668,0,found what you needed but vger
47669,0,hasnt
47670,0,spock
47671,0,has not doctor and now because
47672,0,of what we are planning will not
47673,0,kirk
47674,0,almost hard
47675,0,there is no alternative
47676,0,decker
47677,0,gently pressing
47678,0,mr spock what would vger need
47679,0,to fulfill itself
47680,0,spock
47681,0,vger has begun to understand the
47682,0,true limits of our universe
47683,0,thereby realizing the existence
47684,0,of other dimensions to fulfill
47685,0,itself it must evolve to a
47686,0,higher dimension vger believes
47687,0,this can be achieved only by
47688,0,joining with the creator
47689,0,spock alternative
47690,0,each of us at some time in our
47691,0,life turns to someone a father
47692,0,a brother a god and asks why
47693,0,am i here what was i meant
47694,0,to be vger hopes to touch its
47695,0,creator to find its answers
47696,0,across kirk to decker
47697,0,as decker reacts with sudden almost evangelical en
47698,0,lightenment as kirk says
47699,0,kirk
47700,0,understanding
47701,0,is this all that i am is there
47702,0,nothing more

47706,0,captain
47707,0,past kirk and spock to the viewer
47708,0,
47709,0,where another opening is suddenly visible another
47710,0,chamber but the violent and color energy effects of
47711,0,the previous chambers are no longer evident instead
47712,0,the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical
47713,0,with a strange subdued glow which increases as we
47714,0,move closer
47715,0,spock
47716,0,flat
47717,0,captain i believe that is our
47718,0,destination
47719,0,
47720,0,ext enterrise int vger near the island
47721,0,complex
47722,0,this enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere laced
47723,0,throughout with dazzling energy patterns not at all
47724,0,ominous but quite lovely in effect as the enterprise
47725,0,continues forward motion now ahead you will to see a
47726,0,small island floating in the exact center of the

47837,0,we can still save vger and ourselves
47838,0,all this has caused kirk to vacillate but he still
47839,0,believes his course of action is the proper one as
47840,0,ilia
47841,0,the carbon units will now provide
47842,0,vger the required information
47843,0,ilia is moving toward the elevator turning to face
47844,0,the others as she says this kirk remains frozen his
47845,0,hand on the intercom button he glances at mccoy as
47846,0,though seeking advice mccoy peers at him blandly
47847,0,levelly kirk must follow his own instinct
47848,0,favoring kirk
47849,0,gazing at ilia then at spock his brain racing con
47850,0,sidering all the possibilities options he glances
47851,0,at the anxious faces awaiting his decision a possible
47852,0,twentytwo more minutes of life or instant death
47853,0,another beat as he decides then

47869,0,decker
47870,0,calls after him
47871,0,captain id like to go along
47872,0,kirk studies decker a beat there is something com
47873,0,pelling about deckers manner a certain sense of
47874,0,absolute necessity kirk seems about to deny the re
47875,0,quest then turns to sulu
47876,0,kirk
47877,0,mr sulu you have the conn
47878,0,and kirk leaves decker his face reflecting a strange
47879,0,almost eager gratification hurries after him
47880,0,kirk
47881,0,vger plans to literally meld
47882,0,to reduce both itself and the
47883,0,creator to patterns
47884,0,spock
47885,0,and then to reassemble itself
47886,0,combined with the creator the
47887,0,most certain way of obtaining
47888,0,all the creators answers
47889,0,a sudden storm of light and strange sound in the
47890,0,midst of it kirk finds a shaft of light very much
47891,0,centering on him he sees ilia watching him with
47892,0,none of their former navigator in her expression
47893,0,now kirk hesitates gathering his thoughts
47894,0,kirk
47895,0,to ilia

47900,0,kirk
47901,0,we will answer and present proof
47902,0,of our answer when it is ready
47903,0,kirks words lead to a suggestion of frustration in the
47904,0,storm of light and sound around them
47905,0,kirk
47906,0,continuing
47907,0,vger we will bring the creator
47908,0,to you here
47909,0,angle emphasizing ilia and decker
47910,0,as he moves to her
47911,0,decker
47912,0,we need only a few more minutes
47913,0,believe me
47914,0,decker has reached out to touch her the probe spins
47915,0,at his touch the move knocks decker from his feet
47916,0,tumbling a hard fall then the robe looks at him
47917,0,lying there just the slightest softening of her
47918,0,features now
47919,0,emphasizing decker
47920,0,slowly turning to face the probe again
47921,0,decker
47922,0,ilia believe me the creator
47923,0,will appear
47924,0,emphasizing ilia
47925,0,as she meets deckers look her expression softening
47926,0,still more the storm of light and sound begins to
47927,0,subside a bit she moves to him and he gets to his feet

47954,0,as decker takes her hand
47955,0,decker
47956,0,and when vger melds what will

47958,0,ilia
47959,0,it will take me from you
47960,0,kirk spock and mccoy
47961,0,mccoy is looking at kirk with an incredulous expression
47962,0,on his face
47963,0,mccoy
47964,0,and when it realizes what the
47965,0,creator is
47966,0,kirk
47967,0,theres no way to know vger
47968,0,expected it to be a machine
47969,0,some single entity

47972,0,all of us here may be reduced
47973,0,into patterns
47974,0,spock
47975,0,that seems to be what it has
47976,0,planned to have the creator
47977,0,physically present here
47978,0,mccoy
47979,0,small smile
47980,0,the god it captures is going to
47981,0,be a hell of a disappointment
47982,0,decker and ilia
47983,0,at the side of voyager six decker in the midst of
47984,0,twisting a wingnut which releases a hatch which swings

47991,0,we see decker look up at kirks call then ignore him
47992,0,and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch at
47993,0,this moment from kirks communicator a signal

48011,0,catching decker in the midst of pressing a control on

48016,0,recording
48017,0,kirk spock and mccoy
48018,0,still waiting they continue to wait mccoy shifts
48019,0,uncomfortably throws kirk a puzzled glance kirk
48020,0,finally lifts his communicator
48021,0,kirk
48022,0,enterprise are you transmitting
48023,0,uhuras intercom voice
48024,0,affirmative captain for some

48033,0,calling

48035,0,various angles
48036,0,as the others turn to decker and ilia
48037,0,decker
48038,0,continuing
48039,0,the fault is here sir not in
48040,0,the transmission
48041,0,indicating into
48042,0,hatch
48043,0,the antenna leads have been
48044,0,disconnected vger never
48045,0,intended to accept a transmitted
48046,0,signal
48047,0,kirk
48048,0,capture god in order to
48049,0,retrieve vgers data the
48050,0,creator has to physically come
48051,0,here
48052,0,decker
48053,0,and plug the signal directly into
48054,0,the circuitry at this
48055,0,indicates into
48056,0,access
48057,0,point here captain it
48058,0,should pick up even a tricorder
48059,0,playback
48060,0,kirk
48061,0,lifting communicator
48062,0,enterprise i want that signal
48063,0,again transmit
48064,0,then kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
48065,0,as decker did earlier then he looks up reacts as
48066,0,he sees decker holding his own tricorder up and a
48067,0,smile playing on deckers face
48068,0,action angle
48069,0,as kirk suddenly pivots races toward decker but he
48070,0,passes too close to the iliaprobe it sends him
48071,0,spinning back tumbling to his knees
48072,0,at kirk
48073,0,as kirk starts up to scramble to his feet but spock has
48074,0,stepped in putting a hand on kirks shoulder and re
48075,0,straining him
48076,0,spock
48077,0,jim he wants it
48078,0,decker
48079,0,you got the enterprise its
48080,0,what you wanted this is what
48081,0,i want
48082,0,smiles
48083,0,but jim
48084,0,now very seriously
48085,0,im the right choice for this
48086,0,mission
48087,0,and then decker shoves the tricorder into the access
48088,0,hatch
48089,0,various effects shots decker being fused vger
48090,0,transcending s
48091,0,for just an instant nothing happens and then a
48092,0,blinding shaft of light strikes decker the color
48093,0,becomes brighter and brighter begins spiraling through
48094,0,the room ilia stes toward decker is caught in the
48095,0,light and instantly vanishes in a brilliant white glow
48096,0,we see decker seeming to grow larger as if his
48097,0,molecular pattern is expanding a spectacular series
48098,0,of visuals the spiraling light enveloping the entire
48099,0,area
48100,0,all this emanating from deckers body becoming larger
48101,0,also brighter and brighter until now it is almost
48102,0,transparent and the spiraling now expanding in all
48103,0,directions and the room itself starting to dissolve
48104,0,vanishing into nothingness and all commencing to
48105,0,slip into the new dimension
48106,0,kirk spock and mccoy stand transfixed another instant
48107,0,around them vger seems to be transforming into bril
48108,0,liant lovely patterns they all turn and race into
48109,0,the complex in the direction of their vessel
48110,0,ext earth orbit an energy bolt s
48111,0,it too seems to be flowering into loveliness brilliant
48112,0,graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
48113,0,dimension vanishing
48114,0,ext vger full shot
48115,0,
48116,0,the flowering effect now spreading outward vgers
48117,0,massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting
48118,0,graceful shapes and brilliant colors a transcendence
48119,0,into another dimension
48120,0,and then all of that is left is a shimmering jewellike
48121,0,point of light and then it too fades and reveals
48122,0,there in the blueblack of space the uss enterprise
48123,0,int bridge including the viewer o
48124,0,which shows now only space and its familiar star
48125,0,patterns all gaze at the viewer awed at what theyve
48126,0,seen and undergone they exchange looks silently no
48127,0,one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some
48128,0,thing which is beyond mere words we hear an elevator
48129,0,door scott and chapel enter the bridge and stand
48130,0,silently watching

48145,0,spock
48146,0,looks at kirk then

48969,0,stops staring into the impenetrable dark then he
48970,0,reacts as we hear spocks voice it is hoarse raspy
48971,0,as it was in the final scene with kirk in star trek

49321,0,not finding some trace of spock
49322,0,david
49323,0,well theres your life form
49324,0,reading these were microbes on
49325,0,the tubes surface we shot them
49326,0,here from enterprise
49327,0,with irony
49328,0,they were fruitful and
49329,0,multiplied
49330,0,saavik
49331,0,but how could they have evolved
49332,0,so quickly
49333,0,david doesnt answer his curiosity caught by something
49334,0,else he starts slowly forward saavik following

49355,0,what is it
49356,0,saavik
49357,0,spocks burial robe
49358,0,as they stare at each other without answers the planet
49359,0,makes a gentle rumbling sound then the ground qui
49360,0,vers slightly
49361,0,and in the far distance a poignant cry is heard a
49362,0,young animal in pain perhaps saavik and david do not
49363,0,know
49364,0,cut to

49432,0,sarek i would have come to
49433,0,vulcan to express my deepest
49434,0,sympathies
49435,0,sarek
49436,0,raises a hand
49437,0,spare me your human platitudes
49438,0,kirk i have been to your
49439,0,government i have seen the
49440,0,genesis information and your own
49441,0,report
49442,0,kirk
49443,0,then you know how bravely your son
49444,0,met his death
49445,0,sarek
49446,0,met his death
49447,0,turning on kirk
49448,0,how could you his friend have
49449,0,assumed that why did you leave
49450,0,him on genesis spock trusted you
49451,0,and you denied him his future
49452,0,kirk
49453,0,i saw no future
49454,0,sarek
49455,0,you missed the point then and
49456,0,now only his body was in
49457,0,death kirk and you were the
49458,0,last one to be with him
49459,0,kirk

49464,0,kirk
49465,0,but why
49466,0,sarek
49467,0,because he asked you to he

49481,0,of me
49482,0,sarek
49483,0,he would not have spoken of it
49484,0,openly
49485,0,kirk
49486,0,then how

49490,0,may i join your mind
49491,0,kirk

49493,0,sarek steps close to kirk as camera pushes in very
49494,0,close sareks hands are on kirks temples in familiar
49495,0,splayed fashion and the eyes of both men are closed
49496,0,mind meld sequence
49497,0,this can be literal or can be illustrated by sub
49498,0,liminal film from trek ii to be determined
49499,0,strange submusical sounds underscore the music of
49500,0,vulcan unlike anything we have ever heard before
49501,0,after a moment

49509,0,kirk
49510,0,yes
49511,0,sarek
49512,0,the needs of the many outweigh
49513,0,kirk
49514,0,the needs of the few
49515,0,sarek
49516,0,or the one
49517,0,kirk

49537,0,sarek
49538,0,i see and i understand

49541,0,everything that he knew is
49542,0,lost and when i return home
49543,0,emptyhanded many shall mourn
49544,0,he turns now starting for the door kirk stops him
49545,0,with an agonized wail
49546,0,kirk
49547,0,please wait surely he would
49548,0,have found a way if there was so
49549,0,much at stake spock would have
49550,0,found a way
49551,0,sarek
49552,0,hesitating
49553,0,yes but how
49554,0,kirk
49555,0,rising

49633,0,kirk looks at the screen examines all that is clear to
49634,0,him and accepts the truth of sareks challenge
49635,0,kirk
49636,0,i will i swear
49637,0,over his determined face we hear a weird overlapped

49945,0,mccoy is interrupted by a hand on his arm he looks up
49946,0,to see a nondescriptlooking civilian with a gentle
49947,0,ingratiating manner
49948,0,civilian
49949,0,sir im sorry but your voice
49950,0,is carrying i dont think you

49966,0,civilian
49967,0,federation security sir
49968,0,its a bad moment for the agent to have announced him
49969,0,self a desperate bones releases the alien and rises
49970,0,to his feet just as the waitress arrives with his alt
49971,0,air water on a tray the altair water spills on the
49972,0,alien
49973,0,series of cuts
49974,0,the alien hit by the water leaps to his feet in rage
49975,0,the waitress is knocked into a group of people
49976,0,more spilling of drinks
49977,0,a bystander thinking the alien hit the waitress hits
49978,0,him
49979,0,a general scuffle begins
49980,0,meanwhile mccoy tries to race around the civilians
49981,0,end of the confusion but the agent very big grabs
49982,0,him bones in confusion and panic suddenly turns
49983,0,wildeyed and attempts a vulcan nerve pinch on his
49984,0,tormentor the nerve pinch has absolutely no effect
49985,0,and the agent stares at bones for a long moment
49986,0,civilian
49987,0,youre going to get a nice long
49988,0,rest doctor
49989,0,he ushers bones out as the brouhaha continues in bg
49990,0,cut to
49991,0,ext genesis planet area snowscape
49992,0,it is snowing now and the wind wails as saavik and
49993,0,david appear and come forward into a close shot the
49994,0,life sign sound of their tricorder is beeping faster
49995,0,now as they peer ahead into the snow then saavik
49996,0,suddenly points
49997,0,pov through the snowfall
49998,0,something alive moves across the front obscured by
49999,0,snow and terrain
50000,0,back to them moving camera intercut with pov
50001,0,as they start forward into the snow saavik drawing her
50002,0,phaser they peer ahead seeing nothing but the bleep
50003,0,of their tricorder which they follow like a beacon
50004,0,their pov moving through the snow flurry catches an
50005,0,occasional hint of something ahead which spurs them on
50006,0,then with the tricorder beep indicating very close
50007,0,proximity they stop and intuitively saavik indicates
50008,0,to david to turn the tricorder off as the beep stops
50009,0,they listen and hear the tiniest of whimpers amid the
50010,0,wind they start out excitedly
50011,0,the crevice and intercut povs
50012,0,as saavik and david approach stop tricorder back
50013,0,on big reading they step forward through the snow
50014,0,flurry to see
50015,0,int the crevice the boy
50016,0,a wild thing with scraggly hair perhaps nine or ten
50017,0,years old he covers his nakedness as he shivers in
50018,0,the cold clutching an injured leg he watches the
50019,0,strangers and their beeping machine in hypnotic fear
50020,0,
50021,0,the scene in the crevice
50022,0,at saaviks gesture david turns off his tricorder
50023,0,saavik moves close as she touches the boys leg he
50024,0,pulls back and she reaches out to his face and touches
50025,0,his cheek softly he accepts watchfully then saavik
50026,0,slides her hand slowly and parts the scraggly hair
50027,0,the boy is a vulcan
50028,0,saavik and david exchange and astonished look then she
50029,0,covers the boy with spocks robe and in vulcan
50030,0,saavik
50031,0,i am saavik can you speak
50032,0,the boy does not respond saavik looks to david

52167,0,but kirk in a series of ground rolls trips kruge up
52168,0,with his legs and comes on
52169,0,the offbalance kruge now takes a series of punches
52170,0,from kirk which make him reel backward near the edge of
52171,0,the promontory a final blow from kirk forces kruge
52172,0,over the edge and he
52173,0,tumbles and rolls down the fifteen foot slope kirk
52174,0,peers over the edge to see
52175,0,kirks pov ilm elements
52176,0,kruge has landed on a level precipice about fifteen
52177,0,feet in diameter beyond that is an endless drop into

52180,0,on the precipice up angled ilm elements
52181,0,as kruge rises to his feet kirk without hesitation
52182,0,soars into the air from above and dives upon kruge the

52184,0,of the final drop they work their way to their feet
52185,0,and continue the struggle anew pieces of the rock edge
52186,0,slipping away under their feet as they scuffle kirk
52187,0,is winning until
52188,0,with a burst of energy kruge shoves kirk hard and kirk
52189,0,slams into a wall of stone dazed kruge has him

52205,0,up
52206,0,kirk recovering his own strength sees kruge in this

52217,0,kruge looks down measuring the terror below as if
52218,0,considering then with sudden and explosive strength
52219,0,vaults upward making a desperate grab for kirk he has
52220,0,a leg suddenly kirk is fighting not to be pulled
52221,0,over the edge he is losing that fight till he
52222,0,lashes out with a blow the klingons grip slips yet
52223,0,he hangs on tenaciously until with a cry of rage
52224,0,kirk
52225,0,continuing
52226,0,i have had enough of you

52234,0,caving in around him he starts to scramble up the
52235,0,steep slope back to the promontory where
52236,0,the promontory spock
52237,0,his inert body lies surrounded by new bursts of steam
52238,0,from the cracking earth
52239,0,angle kirk ilm element
52240,0,behind him we see the first signs of a fast rising
52241,0,fireball sun he claws his way back to the top level

52243,0,the body over to see
52244,0,past kirk to spock
52245,0,we see the face at last it is spock at the age he
52246,0,died
52247,0,but he is also a haggard ravaged shell of a being
52248,0,almost again dead from the agonies of change and

52728,0,but not enough spock turns away in uncertainty
52729,0,begins walking back to the group he left kirk raises
52730,0,his helpless hand after spock wondering what he might

52969,0,a door opens and starfleet admiral donald austere and
52970,0,impressive enters and gavels the meeting to order
52971,0,admiral donald
52972,0,this briefing is classified there
52973,0,will be no recording devices
52974,0,ladies and gentlemen the cinc
52975,0,all rise as the starfleet commander in chief enters
52976,0,with a briefcase and pulls materials from it
52977,0,cinc
52978,0,as you were ill make this as
52979,0,simple as i possibly can the
52980,0,klingon empire has roughly
52981,0,years of life left to it
52982,0,they look at each other in disbelief
52983,0,cinc
52984,0,continuing
52985,0,for full details i am turning this
52986,0,briefing over to our special
52987,0,federation envoy
52988,0,he makes a sign and another door opens spock walks to
52989,0,the podium kirk and company are astounded
52990,0,spock
52991,0,good morning
52992,0,vfx omitted vfx
52993,0,spock
52994,0,continuing
52995,0,two months ago a federation
52996,0,starship monitored an explosion on
52997,0,the klingon moon praxis we
52998,0,believe it was caused by over mining
52999,0,and insufficient safety precautions
53000,0,the moons decimation means an
53001,0,almost eighty percent loss of
53002,0,available energy and a deadly
53003,0,pollution of their ozone due to
53004,0,their large military expenditures
53005,0,the klingon economy is in a very
53006,0,weakened condition they do not
53007,0,have sufficient resources to
53008,0,manufacture air shelters in large
53009,0,enough quantities to sustain
53010,0,anything like their current
53011,0,population last month at the
53012,0,behest of the uh vulcan
53013,0,ambassador i opened a dialogue
53014,0,with gorkon chancellor of the
53015,0,klingon high council he proposes
53016,0,to commence negotiations at once
53017,0,admiral donald
53018,0,negotiations for what
53019,0,spock
53020,0,the dismantling of our space
53021,0,stations and star bases along the
53022,0,neutral zone an end to seventy
53023,0,years of unremitting hostility a
53024,0,hostility the klingons can no
53025,0,longer afford
53026,0,audible mutterings pan the crew is the war over
53027,0,spock
53028,0,continuing
53029,0,if the klingons sue for peace we
53030,0,could accumulate savings in defense
53031,0,expenditures leaving the
53032,0,federation economy free to grapple
53033,0,with urgent social problems
53034,0,a military man
53035,0,bill are we talking about
53036,0,mothballing the starfleet
53037,0,cinc
53038,0,im sure our exploration and
53039,0,science programs would not be
53040,0,affected but the facts speak for
53041,0,themselves captain
53042,0,admiral donald
53043,0,i must protest to offer the
53044,0,klingons a safe haven within
53045,0,federation space is suicide
53046,0,klingons would become the alien
53047,0,trash of the galaxy and if we
53048,0,dismantle the fleet wed be
53049,0,defenseless before a bellicose
53050,0,people with a foothold on our
53051,0,territory the opportunity which
53052,0,presents itself here is to embargo
53053,0,trading force them to run through
53054,0,their own resources faster and
53055,0,bring them to their knees then
53056,0,well be in a far better position
53057,0,to dictate terms
53058,0,a vocal minority of the briefing supports this but not
53059,0,all kirk simply stares at spock
53060,0,cinc
53061,0,starfleet is under civilian
53062,0,control admiral the decision is
53063,0,a political not a military one
53064,0,and its been made
53065,0,kirk
53066,0,sir
53067,0,cinc
53068,0,captain kirk
53069,0,kirk
53070,0,eyes spock briefly
53071,0,sir im no diplomat but the
53072,0,klingons have never been
53073,0,trustworthy im forced to agree
53074,0,with admiral donald this is
53075,0,he gropes for tact
53076,0,a terrible a terrifying idea
53077,0,cinc
53078,0,your son was killed by a klingon
53079,0,wasnt he captain
53080,0,kirk
53081,0,yes sir
53082,0,cinc
53083,0,im sorry but commander spock has
53084,0,persuaded the federation that this
53085,0,situation is too promising to
53086,0,ignore
53087,0,spock
53088,0,it is imperative that we act now to
53089,0,support the gorkon initiative lest
53090,0,more conservative elements persuade
53091,0,his empire that it would be better
53092,0,to attempt a military solution and
53093,0,die fighting
53094,0,cinc
53095,0,captain kirk you are to be our
53096,0,first olive branch
53097,0,kirk
53098,0,me
53099,0,spock
53100,0,we have volunteered to rendezvous
53101,0,with the klingon ship thats
53102,0,bringing chancellor gorkon here
53103,0,and escort him safely through
53104,0,federation space
53105,0,kirk is too startled to speak
53106,0,cinc
53107,0,as it happens kirk the chancellor
53108,0,specifically requested you and your
53109,0,officers
53110,0,kirk
53111,0,why in gods name
53112,0,cinc
53113,0,there are some klingons who feel
53114,0,the same about the peace treaty as
53115,0,yourself and admiral donald
53116,0,theyll think twice about attacking
53117,0,the enterprise under your command
53118,0,spock
53119,0,i have personally vouched for you
53120,0,in this matter captain
53121,0,kirk
53122,0,you have personally
53123,0,cinc
53124,0,you will accord chancellor gorkon
53125,0,full diplomatic courtesy captain
53126,0,kirk
53127,0,kirk
53128,0,straining
53129,0,surely a full ambassador would be
53130,0,better equipped to

53139,0,he moves off before kirk can reply the room is

55363,0,weve got a crew of three hundred
55364,0,turning their own quarters inside
55365,0,out but the killers may be among
55366,0,them surely theyve disposed of
55367,0,these boots by now wouldnt it
55368,0,have been logical to leave them on
55369,0,gorkons ship
55370,0,spock
55371,0,even logic must give way to
55372,0,physics gravity hadnt been
55373,0,restored by the time they escaped
55374,0,without their boots they would not
55375,0,have stayed on the klingon
55376,0,transporter pads
55377,0,chekov
55378,0,mimes with his finger
55379,0,why not simply vaporize them
55380,0,lt saavik
55381,0,like this
55382,0,she whips out her phaser and fires incinerating a pot
55383,0,alarms and claxons howl chekov covers his ears
55384,0,lt saavik
55385,0,as you know sir no one can fire
55386,0,an unauthorized phaser aboard a
55387,0,starship
55388,0,she switches off the alarm and has another thought
55389,0,lt saavik
55390,0,continuing
55391,0,suppose when they returned they
55392,0,threw the boots into the garbage
55393,0,spock
55394,0,im having the garbage searched
55395,0,if my surmise is correct these
55396,0,boots will cling to the killers
55397,0,necks like tiberian bats they
55398,0,couldnt make their escape without
55399,0,them nor can they simply throw
55400,0,them out a window for all to see
55401,0,no theyre here somewhere
55402,0,uhura comes into the galley stepping over pots and
55403,0,pans shes not happy
55404,0,uhura
55405,0,did someone shoot off a phaser

55423,0,spock
55424,0,thank you mr scott we were to
55425,0,return to spacedock the killers

55428,0,lt saavik
55429,0,a lie
55430,0,spock
55431,0,an error

55450,0,this time
55451,0,int rura penthe penal colony
55452,0,kirk gets hit in the face its already bloody its

55455,0,kirk and bones are distinctly grubbier
55456,0,kirk scrambles to his feet and circles the alien
55457,0,swings a large paw but kirk ducks comes in with an
55458,0,uppercut he connects but does little damage they
55459,0,circle some more the alien dives legs first and
55460,0,scissors kirk who goes down roughly wrestling kirk
55461,0,slips free
55462,0,bones and martia watch the leg irons make it

55465,0,the alien moves in closely hits kirk again kirk
55466,0,fights back with a kick to the chest which doubles
55467,0,over the alien
55468,0,then kirk slams the alien on the neck and he goes down
55469,0,kirk starts to walk away
55470,0,but a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle kirk
55471,0,looks back and the alien is grinning drags him in
55472,0,stands and grips kirks chest to back in a giant bear
55473,0,hug surely he will crush the life out of kirk
55474,0,he lifts kirk right off the ground kirk almost gone
55475,0,lifts his legs up high and swings down hard smashing
55476,0,the alien in the knee that does it the alien falls
55477,0,to the ground screaming and holding his knee

55502,0,he is without any medical tools of any kind
55503,0,the alien yells but lets him look he manipulates the
55504,0,leg then ties a kind of splint with an old rag

59050,0,you dont swear every other word
59051,0,youll find it in all the literature
59052,0,of the period

59081,0,gillian
59082,0,continuing
59083,0,the cetacean institute is the only
59084,0,museum in the world exclusively
59085,0,devoted to whales as you can see
59086,0,we have a great seal to offer but
59087,0,that is small compared to what we
59088,0,know or rather what wee dont know
59089,0,about whales the first commonly
59090,0,held misconception is that whales
59091,0,are fish
59092,0,theyre not theyre mammals like
59093,0,us warmblooded needing air to
59094,0,breathe and producing milk to nurse
59095,0,their young they are very old
59096,0,mammals million years give
59097,0,or take
59098,0,during the spiel taylor notices kirk in an odd way
59099,0,they connect hes attractive even in his odd clothes
59100,0,and he pays stricter attention than the average joe
59101,0,a man
59102,0,do whales attack people like in
59103,0,moby dick
59104,0,gillian
59105,0,most whales dont even have teeth
59106,0,they strain vast amounts of tiny
59107,0,shrimp for food and that is the
59108,0,limit of their hostility un
59109,0,fortunately their principle enemy
59110,0,is far more aggressive
59111,0,kirk
59112,0,you mean man
59113,0,gillian
59114,0,to put it mildly since the dawn of
59115,0,time men have harvested whales for
59116,0,a variety of purposes most of which
59117,0,can be achieved synthetically at this
59118,0,point a hundred years ago using
59119,0,handthrown harpoons they did plenty
59120,0,of damage but that was nothing
59121,0,compared to what theyve achieved
59122,0,in this century
59123,0,gillian pushes a button and screens modern whalehunt
59124,0,footage pretty gruesome stuff
59125,0,gillian
59126,0,continuing still
59127,0,emotional for her
59128,0,this is mankinds legacy whales

59132,0,the earth
59133,0,beat
59134,0,despite all attempts at banning
59135,0,whaling there are still countries
59136,0,and pirates currently engaged in
59137,0,slaughter of these inoffensive
59138,0,creatures where the humpback whale
59139,0,once numbered in the hundreds of
59140,0,thousands today there are less than
59141,0,thousand specimens alive and those
59142,0,that are taken are no longer fully
59143,0,grown in addition many of the
59144,0,females are killed still bearing
59145,0,unborn calves
59146,0,the pictures graphically illustrate what shes talking
59147,0,about
59148,0,spock
59149,0,to hunt a species to extinction is
59150,0,not logical
59151,0,

59153,0,bitter
59154,0,whoever said the human race was
59155,0,logical

59167,0,the two whales undulate majestically they are
59168,0,colossal kirk and spock react in awe
59169,0,gillian
59170,0,continuing
59171,0,they are mature humpbacks weighing
59172,0,pounds each they wandered
59173,0,into san francisco bay as calves and
59174,0,were brought here we call them

59178,0,its perfect spock a male a
59179,0,female together in a contained
59180,0,space can beam them up together
59181,0,and consider ourselves damn lucky
59182,0,spock reacts oddly to this
59183,0,gillian
59184,0,beautiful arent they and
59185,0,extremely intelligent why
59186,0,shouldnt they be theyre swimming
59187,0,around with the largest brains on

59194,0,as gillian continues the tour
59195,0,gillian
59196,0,despite all the things they are

59200,0,whys that
59201,0,gillian
59202,0,well for one thing we simply dont
59203,0,have the money to keep feeding them
59204,0,a couple of tons of shrimp a day
59205,0,kirk
59206,0,how soon
59207,0,gillian
59208,0,soon its too bad because theyre
59209,0,very friendly as you can see ive
59210,0,grown quite attached to them this
59211,0,way
59212,0,she starts down a spiral staircase that winds around
59213,0,the tank the others follow minus spock
59214,0,angle next to tank window lower level
59215,0,gillian stops with her back to the tank
59216,0,gillian
59217,0,heres a much better way to see
59218,0,george and gracie underwater
59219,0,kirk has begun to look for spock but in vain
59220,0,int tank underwater
59221,0,as gillian continues her spiel camera moves in toward
59222,0,the whales and discovers spock in the water swimming
59223,0,to them he approaches one and looks it in the eye
59224,0,the great eye stares back
59225,0,closer angle underwater
59226,0,spock and the whale are a foot apart spock gently
59227,0,puts his hand on the whale a mind meld a shaft of
59228,0,back lightning makes the mood ethereal
59229,0,ext tank
59230,0,over speakers we hear whale song the crowd reacts
59231,0,gillian
59232,0,what youre hearing is whale song it
59233,0,is sung by the male hell sing any
59234,0,where from six to as long as thirty
59235,0,minutes and then start again in
59236,0,the ocean other whales will pick up
59237,0,the song and pass it on
59238,0,now kirk sees spock in the water behind gillian and is
59239,0,in mild shock he watches wildeyed as spock and whale
59240,0,move through the water in mid mindmeld
59241,0,gillian
59242,0,continuing
59243,0,the songs change every year but
59244,0,we still dont know what purpose
59245,0,they serve are they navigational
59246,0,part of the mating ritual or pure
59247,0,communication beyond our comprehension
59248,0,an older woman
59249,0,maybe hes singing to the man

59259,0,ext edge of tank day
59260,0,spock climbs out and is putting on his robe as gillian
59261,0,comes running to him from a distance followed but

59583,0,what does that mean exactly take
59584,0,their chances

59588,0,rest of the humpbacks
59589,0,to spock
59590,0,what did you mean when you said all
59591,0,that stuff back at the institute
59592,0,about extinction
59593,0,spock
59594,0,i meant
59595,0,kirk
59596,0,he meant what you were saying on the
59597,0,tour that if things keep on the
59598,0,way theyre going humpbacks will
59599,0,disappear forever
59600,0,gillian

59602,0,admiral if we were to assume these
59603,0,whales are ours to do with as we
59604,0,please we would be as guilty as
59605,0,those who caused past tense
